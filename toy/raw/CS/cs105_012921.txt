00:03

And maybe we can

00:05

start with questions if you have them right now.

00:08

Just about this problem,

00:11

do you have any specific questions?

00:13

So we calculate this

00:17

chi-squared that it's supposed

00:19

to tell us the correlation, correct?

00:21

Like the strength of the correlation.

00:23

O we will get there, we'll get there.

00:25

Who didn't even touch that yet? Yeah.

00:26

German church, you know,

00:29

just the set-up and what question while

00:32

you were answering in what is the null hypothesis?

00:34

What is the alternative hypothesis?

00:37

What we covered last time for

00:39

now? That's more or less clear.

00:41

Alright? So we have data,

00:44

1500 people, we're serving the Jamnagar.

00:47

And what's the type of

00:52

literature they prefer was recorded.

00:54

Our data is right here without

00:58

parentheses to 5050 to 101 thousand.

01:01

This is our data. We wanted to

01:05

answer a question about

01:11

the preferences as far as they're reading.

01:15

It is gender specific.

01:19

Now, our null hypothesis is right here.

01:25

These two attributes are independent.

01:31

Our alternative hypothesis,

01:38

these two attributes are correlated.

01:42

Like we said before, we don't

01:47

know if one depends on the other,

01:50

but we can have the answer to

01:52

the question with some probability

01:56

whether they are correlated or not.

02:00

Null hypothesis two attributes are independent.

02:03

We are going to try to see

02:09

that it is a high probability with the hypermobility,

02:12

we can say, yes, they are independent,

02:17

or we can reject this hypothesis.

02:20

If we reject this hypothesis,

02:25

we will see with the probability of,

02:27

for example, for example,

02:30

5%, we are wrong.

02:32

We rejected this hypothesis.

02:35

And with the probability of,

02:37

let's say 5%, we made a mistake by rejecting it.

02:39

If you've seen before this information in this process,

02:46

we can make two types of mistakes.

02:51

Sometimes they're called type one or alpha,

02:53

and type two or type one mistake,

02:56

rejecting the null hypothesis mistakenly.

03:01

And given false positive study results.

03:06

So we reject mistakenly, we should know.

03:09

And type two, as you can guess,

03:13

we failed to reject the null hypothesis when we should

03:16

have rejected o, right?

03:19

We're going to compute chi-square worker efficient.

03:26

To start with. There is nothing difficult here.

03:31

You're just taken the sum across

03:35

each data 0.1234 entry interests here,

03:39

and we're going to have four terms.

03:44

That will be four terms.

03:47

It's going to be just because we're going to sum across

03:52

the rows and the columns.

03:55

Now, what is this expression?

03:57

This expression is going to tell me

04:01

the relative distance of

04:04

expected value from the observed value.

04:06

The further the expected value from the observed value,

04:10

the higher the probability

04:16

is that these events are dependent.

04:20

Right?

04:26

So we're going to measure this difference.

04:28

When I'm seen difference,

04:32

you can see right here that it is

04:34

the difference squared divided by the expected value.

04:37

But what the idea of the meaning of it,

04:42

we wanted to see how far one is one from another.

04:47

They are very, very close,

04:51

then probably the null hypothesis is correct

04:53

that these attributes are in Japan.

04:56

If we expect, if we

05:01

expected approximately which we received.

05:04

Okay?

05:07

So we have our observed values

05:09

and we need to compute our expected values.

05:13

Of course, when you have this formula

05:17

in front of your eyes,

05:19

it is very easy to do so.

05:20

Well, in this case,

05:25

the contact male times the current of

05:28

fiction for the first entry divided.

05:30

But the total.

05:34

So after we've computed

05:35

all these values, we find chi-square.

05:39

We found this chi-square coefficient.

05:44

Now, we need to

05:47

analyze the value of this chi-square coefficient.

05:49

First, we need to find the degrees

05:54

of freedom of our data.

05:59

The formula is simple.

06:05

The number of rows minus one

06:07

times the number of cones minus1.

06:09

I also explained to you last time what it

06:11

means and why it is

06:15

the number of rows minus one and

06:18

the number of columns minus one.

06:20

We're not going to go any deeper into this,

06:22

but if you want, you can either

06:27

read or we can talk about it.

06:28

In our case, we have two rows, two columns.

06:31

So the degrees of freedom is going to

06:35

be two minus one times two minus one, which is one.

06:38

Right now. We can use the following table.

06:43

The degree of freedom is right here.

06:49

That's the degree of freedom. Here.

06:52

How important for us

06:59

or what probability we are okay with.

07:04

If we want to reject the null hypothesis

07:10

and be mistakenly or

07:15

mistakenly reject this null hypothesis.

07:20

Okay, So if we reject the null hypothesis,

07:24

the recent probability that when made the mistake,

07:28

what is this probability?

07:32

We are OK to live with?

07:34

The smallest one.

07:38

The smallest value is 0.001.

07:41

This is the smallest n, this term.

07:47

So if our value,

07:50

and as you can see it is this value is 10 something,

07:53

and our value was fully greater than that, 500.

07:58

If our value is greater than this film,

08:02

then we are ready to reject the null hypothesis.

08:08

In this case, this is

08:15

the smallest possible probability

08:17

of rejecting and being drawn.

08:21

I can reject with this probability,

08:25

this, this, this, this,

08:28

this is a higher probability that I'm

08:29

wrong if I'm rejecting the null hypothesis.

08:32

You can see this distance between

08:35

the observed and expected value right here is small.

08:38

Again, when I'm seeing distance,

08:42

I don't really mean one minus the

08:44

error according to the formula.

08:47

Is that more or less clear?

08:54

So I, I will tell you,

08:59

I am okay with say, 5%.

09:04

Our probability that i am wrong,

09:08

if I reject the null hypothesis.

09:11

I'm looking at the 5% value in this chirp and

09:15

compare the value that is the lowest that I can reject.

09:24

What? If my value is higher than this value?

09:32

Then I will fit this 5% March.

09:37

It's time for you to tell me something.

09:45

Instead. Instead of going out in,

09:58

maybe pulling people individually,

10:05

you just put the poll out

10:08

there and send a message to a large group of people.

10:09

Maybe I'm like social media.

10:12

I'm gonna necessarily not necessarily just

10:13

look at this word crowd sourcing.

10:16

Yes.

10:34

What else?

10:38

Crowd

10:54

sourcing information.

10:56

Data is created by crowd.

11:11

Alright, so you will look and be ready to name.

11:22

It lists 5-7 sources that we can consider to

11:27

be bill sources that are created by crap.

11:32

You will tell me later about this.

11:40

If I ask you, for example, in the midterm.

11:43

But when you think about this term, crowd-sourcing,

11:47

you will think about some,

11:52

something that is done on internet, right?

11:55

And you would be surprised to where the notion

11:59

of crown sources and current sources in when it started.

12:04

It started actually in,

12:09

I believe, 19 0-6.

12:10

And it began with an ox.

12:13

For something like this guy.

12:18

There was a scientist,

12:21

Francis Galton, who was a relative of Charles Darwin.

12:23

You all know Charles Darwin,

12:27

but for some reason we don't know

12:29

Francis Galton and he's the founder of statistical signs,

12:30

maybe some of our statisticians and class notice me.

12:34

He attended livestock fair.

12:38

The villages where asked to

12:42

guess the weight of a particular ox,

12:46

which is guessing who ever would come

12:52

closer to the weight would get some prize.

12:55

Of course, as people were all over with

12:59

the weight that were very different numbers.

13:02

But when they collected all this data

13:05

in phone to the mean of it,

13:07

the mean was very,

13:10

very close to the weight of the guide,

13:12

was 1178 pounds, and the mean was 1179.

13:16

So you can see how incredibly great

13:25

that is that the rule.

13:29

Sometimes it works, wonders.

13:34

Sometimes you may use

13:40

even if you don't know the answer to your question,

13:43

you may ask the crowd to

13:47

answer your question and then find the mean,

13:50

average or the median,

13:54

depending on what you're looking for.

13:56

But you can try to get the information from Crown.

13:59

What I would like us to try doing right now,

14:05

here's a bottle of orange juice.

14:10

Bottle.

14:15

It's I don't know.

14:16

I can't see like maybe about one liter,

14:18

maybe a little bit more in such bottle.

14:25

And you can see the coins right here, but pennies.

14:29

You can try to imagine that bottle,

14:35

the size of, the size of a penny.

14:38

You can increase the size of the screen.

14:40

You can try to imagine the number cubic centimeter,

14:43

and then multiply by what you think is going to

14:50

be the volume of this part of the bottle.

14:53

So anything is fine.

14:56

I'd like you to try to come up

14:58

with a number of pennies in this bottom.

15:01

I'll give you maybe a couple of minutes for that.

15:03

And then do you know your number on? I learned.

15:07

If you don't, I'll just ask it to go on Google Drive.

15:14

I created a document for you to

15:22

put your number just on the next available room.

15:25

After that, we will ask someone to find the mean.

15:31

So first, I'm going to give you

15:36

two minutes to finger. When you're ready.

15:39

I will ask you to type that number.

15:42

And then we'll find the mean and

15:46

we'll see if we're close or not.

15:48

Okay.

15:49

Go oh, professor.

15:50

Document is the only it's on Google Drive.

15:53

Now what we can see the document view only.

15:59

We can't edit it.

16:03

Oh, it's you only I certainly if tempted.

16:04

Yeah.

16:28

Right.

17:07

Be reasonable numbers, okay,

17:38

don't just type random numbers thinking about it.

17:41

Guys, just remember, don't type random numbers.

17:50

Try to analyze what some dead bottle, what can be there?

17:56

How is that not random if we have no data?

18:07

You do, you can imagine

18:11

the bottle not type random numbers.

18:13

I think your type and just some

18:17

of your type and random numbers.

18:18

Can we go with the volume of a penny?

18:21

But you don't need to try to just

18:28

imagine how many pennies you're going to have an a cubit.

18:32

I don't know either centimeter or two-by-two centimeters,

18:35

which is going to be that.

18:39

What I did was I looked online like

18:43

how many pennies are in a jar and I visually and they

18:49

told me they answer the how many pennies are in that jar.

18:52

Kind of gauge.

18:55

What I saw in line. What I'm saying here,

18:57

to make my estimation.

19:00

That's fine to do the machine learning on yourself.

19:02

You want our student IDs next to our guests?

19:25

Oh no, no, no. Of course not.

19:29

You shouldn't be showing you a student IDs to anyone?

19:35

Except for me.

19:41

Well, I wasn't sure because there

19:43

was a bunch of them on the dock.

19:45

No, no, no, no, no, no. When I sit and I

19:46

learned I just meant that order so you

19:51

don't collide in rows.

19:53

Sometimes two people may try to edit

19:57

the same row. Number 13.

20:00

You mister, you deliberately didn't want to put anything.

20:07

And then 2529 and we're done.

20:15

Are you ready

20:26

to finish?

20:38

Didn't put enough effort into the entire course?

20:46

I don't think any one of us can speak to

20:52

the completion of the entire class.

20:54

So I'm just talking

20:57

I'm just asking you if somebody says no, I'm not done.

20:59

That means when I'm done.

21:05

So those that were trying completed, right?

21:12

Okay. Now, somebody please include the valuable.

21:18

There are more coming.

21:29

Include the values from

21:31

the last rows into the missing rows.

21:33

Instead.

21:34

Just copy

21:35

them and find the average.

21:36

Oh, I got the average right here, 143343.

21:46

No-no. Eight it says right here, 843.36 coins.

21:53

Yeah.

22:00

843. Yes.

22:02

We failed the test.

22:04

Wait, we don't know yet because how much do you have?

22:07

I answered by a lot.

22:18

Do you want me double-dot, isn't it?

22:21

Okay, I'm going to delete all this data.

22:25

And I'm going to give you one more chance.

22:28

Where instead of guessing,

22:33

because I notice that I ask you

22:36

a question and I noticed some numbers started showing up.

22:39

That means those students were guessing simply,

22:42

I didn't ask you to guess.

22:45

Remember? I asked you to reason

22:46

about it because guess and it's not going to do anything.

22:49

So I will delete it and I will give you one more chance.

22:53

Alright, here we go.

22:59

You can even count the number.

23:32

If you look at the front right,

23:37

you know the number is way more than what?

23:41

To some students at typing.

23:43

Hey, okay. Okay. Okay.

23:50

Did you give a specification for the volume

24:11

of the bottle or is that supposed to be unknown?

24:14

I didn't give a specification,

24:16

but you should be able to imagine

24:19

the regular bottle of orange juice to get to answers.

24:22

Thank you.

24:27

Any more answers?

24:59

They were more before.

25:07

Last chance. Yes-no.

25:18

Everybody's done.

25:22

Please copy from the bottom rows up or I didn't know.

25:24

As long as you divide by

25:30

the correct number, it doesn't matter.

25:32

It looks like the new averages,

25:46

1900, then you average is nineteen hundred.

25:49

Nineteen hundred.

25:54

I'll tell you the exact number.

26:04

I was close.

26:15

That was very close.

26:17

I'm surprised. You didn't

26:19

know you didn't see any information about this.

26:23

You didn't see the steps before.

26:27

Next time I'll make my own Jarvis paintings.

26:30

I was going to, but in this covered world,

26:34

you don't know where to go, where to get stuff.

26:38

Well, it's actually it's kind of

26:42

like one of the entries is 4500.

26:44

All right. So I think

26:47

they really wanted to push the average.

26:49

They were mad at the group.

26:52

It's possible for someone.

26:54

I didn't see.

27:00

Oh, I think I think that treated it before.

27:02

I did the average function.

27:04

So sometimes you may want to delete Outliers,

27:06

look at outliers from both sides.

27:11

But I didn't know.

27:14

I'm surprised. I've never

27:16

seen I did this test last quarter.

27:17

We didn't have as close.

27:20

Wasn't that bad, but it was really close right now.

27:23

So you think that it doesn't make sense to

27:26

ask everybody and then

27:31

tried to find some meaningful information.

27:33

You would be surprised. Sometimes it works,

27:35

but you need to know

27:38

that cases when it does, when it does.

27:40

Okay. So I'm going to let you go.

27:44

I entertained you a little bit right now.

27:48

Hope you didn't.

27:50
