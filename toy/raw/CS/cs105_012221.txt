00:02

your lumps on your labs.

00:05

The extension hopefully helped

00:08

you finished what you were supposed to finish.

00:10

Jury is going to have office hours today.

00:12

He open to office hours,

00:15

but if you can't make it and if you meet him later,

00:17

you can message him and he's willing to do more today.

00:21

He said he's quite free today.

00:25

So if you need a different time, please ask him.

00:27

Okay.

00:30

Now, next quiz is posted.

00:32

It's due tomorrow night.

00:35

You saw that two.

00:37

You're going to have your first midterm.

00:40

We could five.

00:44

So it's not next week,

00:47

the week after the next week.

00:49

And that's about it.

00:51

We're going to work on data collection.

00:54

I switched from probability to data collection.

00:57

But then we're going to cover

01:02

one more test that is used in statistics.

01:04

And that requires some probability statistics.

01:09

So I deliberately, I am not going to cover it right now.

01:12

I want you to feel calm,

01:16

comfortable with what we started.

01:18

I want you to finish this quiz

01:21

and make sure that you understand the last two,

01:24

the last two parts of the lecture

01:29

that we covered last time.

01:31

And after that, probably on Monday,

01:32

I will cover this last piece

01:34

that goes towards Statistics and Probability.

01:37

Don't want to call it with

01:40

the lecture today is very easy.

01:41

But I would say it should be useful.

01:44

We're going to talk very

01:47

useful for those who

01:50

are going to go into data science field.

01:52

We're going to talk about data collection.

01:55

There are different ways of collecting data.

01:59

And first of all,

02:02

it depends on what type of data you need to collect.

02:04

You may be Researcher in chemistry, biology.

02:09

And I'm not going to help you

02:15

with data collection in that area

02:17

because I don't understand much in that area.

02:18

And I understand that.

02:22

You don't understand either.

02:26

So in that area,

02:27

especially should work on data collection.

02:29

In fact, in each ear,

02:31

it's very useful if the first steps are

02:33

done by specialists who knows

02:36

exactly what they are doing.

02:38

We're going to talk about

02:41

somewhat different type of data collection.

02:44

We will start with surveys.

02:48

And data simply.

02:50

Just to make sure that you remember,

02:54

data can be primary and secondary.

02:58

Secondary data is the data that was

03:00

collected by you or someone

03:02

else and that was used before.

03:04

And primary data is data

03:05

that is collected by, for example, u.

03:07

And it is the first-hand experience.

03:12

And this is what we are going to

03:16

concentrate on right now.

03:18

We're simply going to talk about surveys to start with.

03:20

A population and a sample.

03:26

Suppose you have a question,

03:30

and your question is about a point of view.

03:32

Some views, some maybe statistics

03:38

on a population of the United States.

03:41

Does it mean that you are going to ask

03:44

every attempt to answer your question? Well, you me.

03:47

We do it at least once every couple of years.

03:52

But it is very, very tedious process.

03:56

So usually it's not done that way.

04:02

Usually he would like to find

04:05

some simple that There's going to

04:06

be representative of the population

04:09

that you want to question.

04:12

The results depend on how well you sample.

04:14

For example, you want to learn about,

04:22

let's say, about the political views,

04:27

but not go very far about

04:31

the political views of the United States residents.

04:34

And you're going to say, well,

04:37

it's quite complicated process to ask everybody,

04:39

I live in California and in fact,

04:45

I'm a history student.

04:47

Why don't I just you see your students.

04:49

In fact, maybe I'll just asked students from

04:52

my class is going to be quite representative Willard,

04:55

or will it not in y?

04:59

So if you ask everybody in your class,

05:01

or even if you ask

05:04

everybody at you Sierra, roughly everybody,

05:06

whoever you can get to answer,

05:09

isn't going to represent

05:11

the views of all population of the United States.

05:14

Probably not know why.

05:22

Certain states and probably different states tend to be.

05:32

Even if we're simply talking,

05:39

I'm simplifying it, but it's going to deliver the point.

05:41

Even if we're simply talking about

05:44

being who belongs to

05:48

the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.

05:52

We know that some states are

05:56

Democratic or Republican next.

05:57

So it's the state and geographic location.

06:01

What else?

06:06

A younger audience, Right?

06:17

It's going to probably a younger audience.

06:21

It's going to be 18 to,

06:24

maybe most of the students, 18 to 25.

06:26

Of course there are oldest students,

06:29

but that is going to be a huge chunk of the data.

06:31

So what this younger populations links is not

06:33

necessarily the same as the older population views.

06:38

So it's good to be different.

06:42

And as you point,

06:46

the point that educational levels as well.

06:49

So it is important before you conduct your survey.

06:53

You study, it's important to understand

06:57

what is your population and then

06:59

decide on the simple the techniques of sampling.

07:01

We're going to look at the techniques right now.

07:06

We're going to check two types of techniques,

07:08

probabilistic techniques

07:14

and non-probabilistic techniques.

07:15

You're going to tell me

07:21

why the following technique may work or may not work.

07:23

Is it good or not?

07:28

Sometimes,

07:29

sometimes some very simple technique

07:31

that seems like it's not going to good,

07:34

it's not going to be a very representative.

07:38

It may work. So you need to think, you need to know.

07:41

Let's look at this example.

07:45

We can talk telephone survey to find out

07:48

about the credit use of households in columns.

07:51

We take a simple random sample of

07:54

listings in the white pages of the telephone book.

07:57

Simple random sample.

08:01

We open the book and say here,

08:03

I'm going to call this person. Alright?

08:06

Alright.

08:11

Is it going to be representative of the population?

08:13

Is this a useful sampling technique?

08:30

Or it may suffer from some problems. What do you think?

08:35

Okay, what kind of problems?

08:44

And great people with

08:48

no phone or it skews towards those who own businesses.

08:51

And that is true too.

08:56

And if your phone is not in this book,

09:06

then you certainly not going to be called, right?

09:10

Okay, next example.

09:14

Suppose the survey organization

09:17

conducts a telephone survey and

09:18

asked respondents how many hours a week they work.

09:20

The interviewers themselves work

09:24

from nine to five Monday through Friday.

09:27

So this is the time that they work.

09:29

They call people from nine to five Monday through Friday.

09:33

And they ask them

09:37

about the number of hours in English that they work.

09:38

Is it a biased survey?

09:43

Are they going to have information that is

09:46

going to represent the population or not?

09:48

Why not?

09:57

Why not?

10:00

People will be working when

10:02

they call so they won't even be able to pick up.

10:04

Okay.

10:06

Those that work from nine to five,

10:07

they will never be available.

10:09

And then you are

10:10

removing from your sample all those people.

10:12

That work nine to five Monday through Friday.

10:14

Right? Now some of

10:18

this sampling bias that you also need to think,

10:21

whether it is intentional bias or non-intentional buys.

10:25

Remember, you can always conduct an interview or survey.

10:29

If you want to skew your data.

10:36

It's always possible.

10:39

If a person is a dishonest researcher,

10:41

it's always possible to intentionally skew the results.

10:44

This is not what we're talking about

10:49

right now with talking about

10:51

those researchers that honestly trying to

10:54

conduct a survey and they are taken,

10:58

they think is a very representative.

11:03

But the results may come out

11:06

not quite what they want for not

11:10

quite representing the situation,

11:13

because they didn't think about sampling for long enough.

11:17

And here you can see interviews and

11:23

responders can also skew the outcome of the survey.

11:27

Why? Thinking about this occasion?

11:34

Somebody's asking you a question.

11:39

It may be an interviewer,

11:42

server or it is some sort of astronomy.

11:43

But when the question is asked personally

11:46

and do in a conversation, a person says,

11:49

by the way, were you born in,

11:51

you realize that you were born in the same city.

11:54

Don't you think that somehow you will

11:57

tend to agree with his views?

11:59

Now, if you are certain

12:03

about your instrument, then probably not.

12:05

But if you think

12:09

this way may be stepped way, I'm not quite sure.

12:11

You will tend to agree with the interior.

12:13

If you find something in common,

12:16

if you find that you like the interviewer and so on.

12:18

So this may be biased,

12:21

which means that if you want to eliminate that,

12:23

maybe some interview that eliminates

12:29

a person of the interviewer

12:32

may be some that you'll go into science.

12:35

Some interview that you're going to send

12:38

simply is going to be better in this case.

12:40

And another one is far as responders,

12:43

maybe I don't want to tell the truth.

12:46

Maybe I feel that.

12:48

Well, if I said that,

12:52

how's he going to look at me?

12:54

So this kind of attitude may also skew the results.

12:56

Well, maybe I simply forgot.

13:01

Now, as I said,

13:03

we're going to look at two types of

13:05

simply probabilistic and non-probabilistic sampling.

13:08

Probabilistic.

13:12

When we conduct to simply,

13:14

we know exactly what is the probability of

13:17

a particular group or

13:22

a person depending on the service is to be selected.

13:25

And when it is non-probabilistic,

13:29

then we don't have random sampling.

13:32

Random sampling.

13:35

All right, we have 12 people here.

13:37

We know we need four for our simple.

13:42

We just take four of this 12 at random.

13:46

And as you can see,

13:53

in a class, for example,

13:56

we have 40 students,

13:58

or right now, exactly right now we have 40 students.

13:59

I read the names, put them in the head and

14:02

they'd just pull item behead,

14:04

thought five names and ask questions.

14:06

Ok, so it is random sampling.

14:09

First question, why it may be good?

14:12

Please talk, say something.

14:26

More accurate data removed some elements of bias.

14:30

Bias of picking the response right?

14:37

No favoring correct, no variables.

14:40

Okay.

14:44

What would you say is the biggest advantage of

14:45

such sibling of this advantage of

14:48

such simply equal representation

14:52

of the population.

15:01

The civic question.

15:05

It's simple.

15:09

It's simple.

15:11

It is simple.

15:13

So dependent on what exactly you want to ask.

15:15

You may use random sampling.

15:20

Now.

15:23

Well, it is very simple.

15:26

There is nothing to do.

15:28

There is no preparation.

15:28

You know, the probability of each student,

15:30

in our case, each student to be to be chosen and so on.

15:34

Can you give me an example, S2?

15:39

When you don't want to use random sampling, for example,

15:43

I would like to get an answer to this question

15:46

and I will conduct to a random sampling.

15:49

Now, show me when

15:52

this sampling is not going to be representative.

15:55

It does guarantee distribution of

16:00

the sample size is large enough. That is true.

16:04

I thought It's actually complicated because

16:08

it's not always easy to get it completely random.

16:10

Well, that is somewhat true.

16:13

But for our purposes,

16:16

if we do have

16:19

40 students in the class and if we do it this way,

16:21

then it is pretty random.

16:24

Now, when you wanted to

16:29

analyze a specific group or population,

16:32

but it's not finished.

16:35

So what happens when you want to

16:38

analyze a specific group or population?

16:40

Using simple random sampling won't give you

16:53

a good representation of the groups.

16:56

Will give you what won't give you

16:59

a good representation of the groups,

17:02

will not give you a good representation of the groups.

17:04

The easiest example right here,

17:06

that obvious example of right here.

17:11

Suppose we want to.

17:13

For example, we want to learn

17:17

if point of view of female students.

17:20

And you know that the population of

17:24

female students at UC are in C is clauses.

17:27

It's just horribly under-represented.

17:31

So if I randomly pick ten students out of 40,

17:34

I will have only very low percent

17:38

of female students, if any.

17:41

And we are going to be under-represented as usual.

17:43

Right?

17:48

Well, when we're talking about a group of

17:49

female students being net percentage wise much lower,

17:54

and then a group of male students.

17:59

So in this case,

18:01

we don't want to use grandmom simpler.

18:03

Think about your question.

18:05

Think about your population.

18:07

They have read time when you

18:09

conduct your serving. Alright?

18:11

Next, stratified sampling.

18:13

Stratified simply.

18:17

So what do we do right here?

18:20

We split the population into groups.

18:23

And then we will pick from each group.

18:28

We will pick randomly at that point, some members.

18:34

If you can see 12 students,

18:40

12 people right here split into

18:43

four groups and we picked one into the simple.

18:46

All right.

18:54

Why it is good?

18:57

What you said before.

19:08

If we have different groups,

19:10

then we certainly are going to have representatives from

19:12

each group in simple random sample can miss those.

19:17

A stratified sample.

19:22

It's not going to miss those because for example,

19:25

we're going to split male and female students or

19:27

students from different origins into different groups.

19:30

And we will make sure that

19:33

every group will send a representative into the center.

19:35

Right?

19:41

So sometimes you may want to think about

19:42

stratified sampling as opposed to

19:46

just simple random sampling, cluster, sampling.

19:48

Cluster sampling, we divide

19:52

all the population in the groups.

19:55

Again, just like in stratified sampling.

19:59

But we're not looking for

20:01

representatives from each group.

20:03

Instead, with taken several of this group's completely.

20:06

And an example that is given here is

20:11

an airline company wants to serve its customers one day.

20:14

So they randomly select five flights for the day.

20:18

And the survey, every passenger on those flights,

20:23

for example, they have a 100 flights.

20:27

They randomly picked five in

20:29

then the surveyed all people on those flights.

20:32

When is it not good?

20:37

Give me one example

20:47

right here for this particular example.

20:51

When this is not going to work,

20:54

your clusters could be selected in a way

21:05

that excludes a certain group,

21:08

for example, automotive sectors

21:10

and there'd be locally representatives, right?

21:13

So if we have a normal day

21:15

and we know that to all of those flights were the same,

21:18

all of the machines, all of the planes are the same.

21:21

And technically the population or

21:24

the passengers on each flight or the BOD,

21:27

of course they're not about the same.

21:31

And the question is not sensitive,

21:35

very sensitive to, let's say,

21:38

where the slightest goal.

21:40

So in that case, it's very good.

21:43

If we know that it is, probably

21:46

sometimes it happens is

21:48

special day and there were a lot of,

21:50

let's say, personal jets right here.

21:51

So right here, it can be also skewed,

21:53

but sometimes it is going to work and it may be very,

21:56

very easy to do the sampling this way.

22:00

For example, the same at you, sir.

22:03

It you see are maybe,

22:06

let's say we have 12 thousand of classes.

22:10

If you continue Serbian in each class.

22:13

First of all, it's a lot of time,

22:16

of course, a lot of time, a lot of data.

22:18

Maybe we just want to have a quick survey and we

22:20

don't need to spend so much time, so much.

22:23

And asked for many people to do so.

22:26

And some people are going to be constantly serve it.

22:29

If I keep going to or from one cluster another,

22:33

for example, I go to 11115,

22:37

then I will go to 100.

22:39

And it happens that some students

22:41

are taken all of those clauses.

22:42

So we will end up with some results,

22:44

multiple results from the same students and so on.

22:48

But probably I can just pick

22:52

particular classes that meet at ten o'clock today.

22:55

And I will pick five classes out of

22:59

those and I will ask a question.

23:01

So in some situations it may work.

23:04

Maybe if I ask a question something

23:09

about non-related to studies,

23:11

let's say about either house in maybe or maybe.

23:14

Some food court questions that do not necessarily,

23:18

they are not necessarily connected to a major.

23:24

They did that was going to work.

23:27

And that's going to be some simple enough, right?

23:28

Alright, systematic sampling is very,

23:31

very similar to the random sampling.

23:34

But in this case,

23:38

we somehow order all the participants.

23:39

For example, students in class,

23:42

just order them according to

23:45

their names and give a number for they just numbered.

23:48

And I'm going to say,

23:53

I will pick the first students randomly from one to ten.

23:55

Let's say a student that has number seven.

23:58

And then I will pick all students

24:02

that are ten away from that students.

24:05

So I will pick 71727 and so on.

24:08

So it is a systematic sampling.

24:11

I, I know Alex

24:14

mentioned that random sample and is not quite random.

24:18

In this case.

24:20

It's a little bit,

24:22

at least you will believe

24:26

that there is a little more randomness to it,

24:28

even though it is systematic.

24:32

Now, even here, you can always argues me.

24:35

Because if you have a group of students of

24:40

a particular origin that tend to

24:44

have names that start with a particular letter.

24:47

In that case, it's going to be biased.

24:50

You can never what?

24:53

Vice completely, but you can try.

24:55

Alright? Now we're going to look at

24:58

to those sampling techniques

25:02

that are not probabilist, non-probabilistic.

25:05

In this case, I cannot give a probability

25:08

with which it participant will

25:11

get or each person will become

25:14

a participant of disturbing a convenience sample.

25:16

I'm going to go outside.

25:20

For example, you see are the only reason I continue

25:23

using your sarah because this is

25:27

one place that hopefully a lot of,

25:29

you know, maybe some of you

25:31

still don't if you transfer students.

25:32

But maybe I'm going to get out of,

25:35

let's say, of our building of CS.

25:41

I will I will serve a students that walk by.

25:46

I don't know what kind of service isn't going to work.

25:53

Is it going to work?

26:10

So I'll just stand

26:22

outside of Winston charcoal,

26:29

which is our CS building.

26:34

I will survey those students that walk by.

26:38

Is it going to be biased, unbiased to biased?

26:44

Why?

26:50

Because students have particular major,

26:54

students of CS major or going to be it higher advantage.

26:57

And most of the students are going

27:01

to be seen as students right here.

27:03

So it does, if it doesn't matter to me,

27:04

then it's going to be okay.

27:07

For example, again, if I'm talking about

27:08

their food habits, even though it,

27:11

we can go deeper into this question,

27:14

we can understand that even in that case,

27:17

it may be biased as well,

27:19

but sometimes it can work.

27:22

For example, if a researcher is

27:24

asking people inside of a particular mall, you know,

27:27

when they Serbian political views, they sometimes,

27:31

well before calving, they would park themselves in malls,

27:36

is advice to not well.

27:40

And not that bad, but still it is biased.

27:42

All Convenience Sampling is biased.

27:44

Now, what else?

27:49

Voluntary response. If you agree,

27:51

if you want to vote for this candidate,

27:56

if you want to give you a pinion,

27:58

dial, this for example.

28:00

So you can understand that in a lot

28:03

of cases it may not have forming or Teller plan,

28:05

may be busy, may be traveling and so on.

28:09

So it is not the best way of sampling.

28:12

Now, each of this sampling techniques exist,

28:15

and you can always use each of these techniques.

28:20

You just need to know the positive

28:24

and the negative and went when to use them.

28:27

Because sometimes they do work

28:31

judgment and snowball sampling judgment.

28:33

I think this person will be good for my survey.

28:36

I think that person will be good.

28:40

That's judgement.

28:42

And snowball sampling.

28:44

I decide on the first tier of verse founders,

28:47

for example, I pick the first five people

28:53

to be in my sample.

28:56

And then I asked each of those to pick five people each.

28:57

So that would be a snowball sampling.

29:02

And each of those five, we'll pick,

29:05

each of those 25, will pick five each, and so on.

29:07

So of course, those supplies,

29:11

but sometimes they may want.

29:13

Now, when, for example,

29:15

that's the simplest out of those with

29:17

this convenience, simply Nate, work.

29:20

When would you say what is

29:23

a positive feature of this convenience sampling?

29:26

For positive features of this convenience simply.

29:31

I think it's just dependent on what you are trying to

29:35

get out of the sampling, right?

29:37

But what is First, let's start.

29:40

What is positive about it?

29:42

Why would we want to

29:44

sometimes conduct Convenience Sampling,

29:46

even though we know it can be horribly biased.

29:49

Theoretically easier to get data.

29:51

Absolutely, it is very easy.

29:53

You just get out of wherever you

29:56

are and start asking questions.

29:58

Or find more or less suitable location.

30:00

You don't need to do

30:03

a particular preparation of a certainly you don't

30:05

need to get data on

30:07

on on the people that you want to serve it,

30:09

those emails, you don't need to find a way to sand

30:12

and to collect and so on. So it's easy.

30:15

Now, it is horribly biased.

30:21

And lot of times, when would you want to use it?

30:24

Probably on a focus sample group,

30:36

depending on what your target is

30:39

and what an a focus sample group.

30:41

Well, that's true, that's true.

30:44

But still you can not getting

30:47

good representation no matter what you're targeting.

30:49

Yeah, it wouldn't be a good representation.

30:51

But from your example before,

30:53

if you're standing outside of Winston Jiang Hall,

30:55

you would have that skewed data where it's not truly

30:57

randomized or it's still within that,

30:59

that focus sample group.

31:02

To some degree.

31:04

It may not be fully, but that's,

31:05

that would be the majority.

31:07

Right.

31:10

Still I don't know.

31:15

7 May 6 be refined and M

31:19

five exits maybe Auto Winston Chang independent and

31:22

where you stand and you're not even going to

31:26

get a good representation of CS students.

31:27

So you're not going to get

31:34

a good representation in any case.

31:37

Why? Sometimes you still may

31:41

want to use somebody ask d like this cheese.

31:45

That's a good example, by the way.

31:52

When the bias has no effect on the data.

31:55

Well, bias always has effect on the data.

31:59

But maybe what you meant is correct.

32:03

If you're trying to prove something I,

32:07

you know, movie suddenly scheme,

32:12

you can go to a specific location and just get

32:14

people who you know will like

32:18

participate and prove your point.

32:21

But that may be then

32:24

the researcher himself was not very honest, right?

32:28

So if your only goal is to prove your point,

32:32

then you can always figure out where to go to do that.

32:35

What's your name here?

32:40

For convenience sampling.

32:42

What's your overall question here?

32:44

The question is, when would

32:46

you want to use convenience sampling?

32:48

When is it OK?

32:50

You can use it as a precursor to more advanced sampling.

32:52

So exactly, exactly was just gonna say yes, yes.

32:56

So you are all get into it right now.

33:01

If you are not quite sure

33:03

what to ask on your main survey,

33:06

you are just touching and trying.

33:09

And you wanted the first opinion.

33:13

You're just prepare yourself

33:16

even with the cheese example,

33:18

you want to ask.

33:20

And if you see that out of

33:21

a 100 people that you ask to try the cheese,

33:23

99 said that it is horrible.

33:27

Then maybe the store doesn't,

33:30

isn't going to even try to carry this cheese, right?

33:33

So it's good enough and the example is good.

33:36

But for example, a company,

33:39

well, let's even say Apple or Samsung.

33:43

They wanted to bring a new product to the market and

33:47

they grab all these people and they ask her,

33:50

would you like something like this to be on the market?

33:54

And let's say 90 out of a 100 will say yes,

33:57

then they can continue with this survey.

34:01

They can think about better questions,

34:03

more specific questions that are

34:06

talking about some technical

34:08

details and so on and so forth,

34:10

and some costly survey.

34:11

But if the answer immediately is going to be no by 95,

34:14

5%, we'll say maybe,

34:19

they will think that maybe it's not Goodman.

34:21

Let's forget about it.

34:23

So it can be pre-survey.

34:25

It is very cheap, very fast,

34:27

very easy to conduct.

34:29

So don't completely throw it out.

34:33

It may be useful.

34:37

All right.

34:39

Some examples I'm not going to give you.

34:42

The interests may be you will,

34:45

may be you will not.

34:47

And after that, I have

34:48

several minutes to talk about something.

34:50

Each student at a school has

34:52

a student identification number.

34:54

Counselors have a computer,

34:56

and they're good to generate

34:58

50 random identification numbers.

35:01

And those students are asked to take the survey.

35:03

What type of sampling is this?

35:06

All of your say in simple random sampling.

35:12

Okay.

35:17

Simple random sample.

35:18

A principal orders t-shirts and wants to check

35:20

some of them to make sure they were printed properly.

35:23

She randomly selects two of the ten boxes of

35:26

shirts and checks every shirt in those two boxes.

35:30

Cluster CCC cluster.

35:37

A school chooses three

35:43

randomly selected athletes from each

35:44

of its sports teams to

35:48

participate in a survey about athletics at a school.

35:50

What type? Stratified.

35:53

Okay, great.

35:56

Alright.

35:59

So what I would like you

36:01

to what I would like to talk about right now.

36:03

I'm not going to go to data processing today.

36:06

That's going to be the next time

36:09

we're going to finish data processing and

36:11

the testing that I told you

36:14

about at the beginning of class.

36:18

And then you will have your midterm.

36:21

It's going to be on week five. Right now.

36:25

I think it will be on Monday, week five,

36:29

Monday, I will tell

36:31

you which lecture is going to be the last one.

36:33

So it will be this data pre-processing

36:36

plus some technique that I included into,

36:39

into the lecture statistics.

36:44

By the way, I uploaded the slides,

36:46

I just divided them a little differently.

36:48

If you want, you can upload from Google Trends.

36:50

In what I would like you to do after we finish this,

36:54

I would like you to write a survey.

36:58

This survey, I will allow you to group,

37:01

for example, in groups of five, that's fine.

37:05

I will post something on Google Drive

37:07

so you can create those groups easily.

37:09

You'll be just writing your names

37:11

or whatever the way he wanted to create the groups.

37:12

And you're going to give this survey.

37:15

Now, listen, please, either to this class better,

37:19

2111, simply because we

37:25

have many more students

37:27

in 111 and I'm teaching right now.

37:30

Can ask them to fill.

37:32

Yeah. Now, I I'm also teaching 141.

37:33

If there is something that you want to compare,

37:37

I can ask those students to fill out the survey as well.

37:39

So these are the students that can't take,

37:43

but kinda disturbing if you have a way to

37:50

give it to someone else where

37:53

you would have at least 40-50 atleast 40-50 responders,

37:56

then we can talk and you

38:01

probably can do it. It depends on.

38:03

These people are going to be.

38:06

Now, what I would like you to do is to

38:07

create a meaningful survey.

38:10

This survey is going to be graded.

38:12

This survey is going to be a part of one of your labs.

38:15

You're going to create. You're going to

38:18

collect the data, you're going to clean it.

38:20

Instead of putting it towards your final projects.

38:21

We're going to do it right now so you

38:26

won't deal with it at the end of the quarter.

38:28

So this is just a way to redistribute your work.

38:31

Looking at the last quarter, it may

38:34

be a little more convenient for you.

38:36

Then when you finalize your project

38:38

and when you get your data later on,

38:40

you may need cleaning,

38:43

but you're not going to do

38:45

anything that I would require you to do.

38:47

You just do whatever is

38:49

needed for your particular project,

38:50

which at that point is going

38:52

to be straightforward for you.

38:53

Now, what you want to do right now is to think

38:55

of what kinds of questions you want to ask.

39:00

Now. I would like you right now to tell

39:06

me what types of questions aren't good.

39:10

Or just give me some examples

39:14

of questions that you think,

39:16

no, this is not good.

39:18

Now, what kind of,

39:19

if you are given multiple choice,

39:22

what kind of answers are not going to work?

39:23

Give me some examples right now, please.

39:27

An example of a question that is

39:37

not going to work and divide.

39:39

I, you see a student

39:41

ask 111 students if they see a student's.

39:43

Well, you may be surprised.

39:47

The rescuers from statistics, sometimes biology,

39:50

sometimes a lot of my students.

39:52

So that's a normal question.

39:54

That's ok.

39:56

Well, if you ask if they're English majors, probably.

40:00

But it's not a bad question.

40:04

Maybe it's just not going to be

40:07

useful because it's easy to answer.

40:09

No, I'm not, right.

40:12

And so does the word green start

40:14

with G? Useless question.

40:17

Yeah, these are useless questions.

40:19

It's not that they're bad questions

40:22

that interest useless that you write.

40:25

So what question?

40:27

That sometimes you see in surveys?

40:29

I'm not I'm not asking you to make up useless questions.

40:32

Sometimes you see these types of

40:36

questions in service. I think about it.

40:38

You've taken a number of surveys before, right?

40:41

And then you have written this question

40:44

and you think to yourself,

40:46

what do they mean by it?

40:47

So if you can't make sense,

40:49

if you don't understand what they mean.

40:50

If you don't understand

40:53

what they're asking about exactly,

40:55

sometimes the question may have two parts

40:56

and only one choice to answer.

40:59

Do you like this or that?

41:01

For example?

41:05

No matter but wait to ask.

41:07

Do you like 08:00 AM classes

41:09

or or you're like more technical classes?

41:13

Okay.

41:19

Would you like some fish or go for a walk?

41:22

Something like that.

41:25

So if the question has two parts,

41:26

the answer must have

41:29

all those parts of combinations

41:34

that a person who's taken disturbing me,

41:36

insert, used Focus, direct questions exactly.

41:39

In order to collect the data you

41:43

can use and cleaned rather than

41:45

vague questions is they

41:46

lead into vague answers? Very good.

41:47

Do you have experienced coding?

41:51

Human? This is a bad question.

41:55

Again, this is one of those questions that

41:57

is probably if you don't know,

41:59

Remember what I started with.

42:02

If we wanted to conduct to

42:04

some if we wanted

42:06

to collect some data in biology or chemistry,

42:09

for example, I'm not going to do

42:11

it because I have no clue what to do,

42:13

how to do what to ask,

42:15

and how to conduct the experiment.

42:16

Now, if you're asking questions to

42:20

111 students that you should know that they've

42:23

taken CS classes, right?

42:25

You need to know the participants and their big ground,

42:27

at least to some degree.

42:31

By when should we have the survey ready again?

42:34

Again? Or you want me to repeat?

42:43

There is no deadline just yet.

42:47

We just started and I want you to start thinking.

42:50

I want you, I will ask you to

42:54

create groups and come up with some questions.

42:56

On Monday, you'll start thinking about it.

42:58

And then I would say,

43:01

maybe by Wednesday, you should have it.

43:03

Maybe.

43:06

But I would like to talk to you on Monday and

43:08

see if you have your questions.

43:12

And then he will start combining.

43:15

Your groups are combined.

43:16

If multiple groups want to.

43:18

If multiple groups wanted to give this questions 2111,

43:21

then you need to collaborate.

43:26

I I don't know if SRE if you would be willing to be ahead

43:28

of process because you

43:32

take an 111 last time last quarter.

43:35

I had also student that was taken one of 5111,

43:37

be in charge of the process to get places?

43:41

No.

43:48

I just send everyone's surveys

43:48

and the CS101 and link group turn.

43:52

We will talk about it later. We will talk about it.

43:55

If you agree, then it will be easier for me to

43:58

communicate just with you than

44:02

with all the groups that are not insisting.

44:04

You will just kick other groups and

44:09

make sure that they're done where a particular day.

44:11

Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.

44:15

Is it possible that someone is

44:18

taken 141 with me right now?

44:21

Do the group members have to

44:24

be in the same lab session though,

44:27

if you can, can communicate over

44:29

email Slack, that's fine with me.

44:30

You don't need to do during

44:33

the lab session if

44:34

it is convenient for you to communicate.

44:36

Right?

44:39

Because during the lobby can be put into

44:40

the breakout rooms and it is

44:43

very convenient to do during the law.

44:44

Well, you can just ask your

44:49

group members to join the team.

44:51

That's fine.

44:52

Do you have any questions?

44:54

You ask me to post the recording?

44:57

And I did I think on

45:00

Wednesday and to remember or yesterday, weapons.

45:03
