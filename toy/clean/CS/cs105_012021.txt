In
this
video
we're
going
to
look
at
Bayes
Theorem
which
is
a
very
powerful
piece
of
mathematics
that
gives
us
some
insight
on
he
said
better
before
we
can
team
Alright
once
of
probability
that
you
might
have
or
not
have
a
disease
actually
is
Now
before
we
get
into
the
mathematics
we
need
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
what
do
we
mean
when
we
say
a
test
is
accurate
In
fact
test
accuracy
actually
subdivides
into
two
different
components
There's
one
factor
called
sensitivity
and
then
there's
another
factor
called
specificity
What's
the
difference
The
idea
with
sensitivity
is
whether
the
test
is
sensitive
enough
to
detect
when
someone
actually
has
the
virus
If
you
have
a
test
with
a
low
level
of
sensitivity
you
might
get
a
lot
of
false
negatives
because
even
though
they
may
have
the
disease
that
test
is
not
sensitive
enough
to
pick
it
up
And
then
specificity
is
the
other
side
Specificity
said
Do
we
know
that
actually
how
this
specific
disease
if
you
have
a
test
with
too
low
of
a
specificity
it
may
give
you
a
lot
of
false
positives
where
the
test
tells
you
how
the
disease
but
you
actually
don't
Okay
so
what
is
the
situation
in
terms
of
sensitivity
or
the
test
available
for
but
coronavirus
Well
it
turns
out
there's
actually
two
different
categories
of
tests
that
we're
using
right
now
The
first
our
genetic
tests
And
this
is
the
ones
you've
seen
most
of
the
news
when
a
number
of
new
cases
are
reported
And
genetic
test
is
one
There
it
goes
and
swabs
your
nasal
cavity
And
then
it
uses
something
called
PCR
or
polymerase
chain
reaction
to
basically
rapidly
expand
the
amount
of
genetic
code
in
the
sample
And
then
it's
able
to
test
the
actual
genetic
markers
to
see
whether
or
not
you
have
the
test
Now
the
good
news
is
that
these
genetic
tests
have
an
extremely
extremely
high
amount
of
specificity
That
is
if
it's
you're
positive
you're
extremely
likely
to
actually
be
positive
Of
course
we
can
never
be
100%
certain
Maybe
some
sample
gets
computed
in
a
lab
but
nevertheless
a
very
high
degrees
of
specificity
Unfortunately
sensitivity
isn't
always
as
high
For
example
if
you
get
a
swab
you
may
actually
have
the
disease
but
it
hasn't
managed
to
pick
up
the
virus
in
that
particular
swab
and
is
more
likely
to
case
if
it's
early
on
and
you
have
not
developed
as
large
a
bloom
of
virus
population
in
your
navel
canal
And
indeed
depending
on
the
specific
test
this
could
be
better
or
worse
One
example
for
instance
the
United
States
is
very
common
is
the
Abbott
Lab
Test
And
once
they
leave
this
showed
that
it
might
have
as
much
as
a
15%
false
negative
rate
That
is
when
it
tests
and
says
you're
negative
but
you
actually
are
positive
Numbers
like
this
are
hugely
problematic
worth
it's
quite
hard
to
tell
what
the
true
numbers
aren't
any
particular
case
it
requires
a
lot
of
study
to
investigate
So
those
are
the
genetic
tests
which
in
general
have
very
very
high
levels
city
but
perhaps
somewhat
lower
levels
of
sensitivity
The
other
completely
different
category
of
tests
are
called
antibody
tests
This
is
a
collection
of
your
blood
to
see
whether
you
have
the
antibodies
created
by
our
immune
system
to
fight
the
disease
and
has
the
benefit
that
it
can
look
way
in
the
past
if
you
retain
those
antibodies
for
some
time
even
after
you've
gone
clear
you
no
longer
have
any
symptom
you
no
longer
infectious
It
might
still
show
those
antibodies
similar
to
genetic
tests
The
antibody
tests
also
have
some
level
of
false
negatives
But
what
is
perhaps
more
problematic
is
that
they
also
have
some
amount
of
false
positive
That
leaves
it
depends
on
which
particular
antibody
tests
And
this
can
be
a
really
big
problem
Indeed
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
this
might
happen
is
that
it
may
detect
something
that
was
an
antibody
from
some
other
coronavirus
that
doesn't
necessarily
cause
coded
19th
specifically
And
we're
gonna
see
that
at
least
when
the
prevalence
of
the
virus
is
low
within
society
that
the
probability
that
you
actually
have
the
disease
despite
testing
positive
in
that
scenario
was
going
to
be
far
larger
than
you
might
initially
suspect
Alright
so
let's
do
some
math
to
get
started
on
our
probability
computation
I
want
to
begin
with
the
idea
of
conditional
probabilities
And
the
first
thing
I'll
do
is
just
get
some
variable
names
just
to
make
our
notation
a
bit
simpler
will
say
Cobb
is
just
going
to
be
yes
you
actually
have
the
disease
and
df
for
disease-free
plus
four
that
you
test
positive
and
minus
four
let
you
test
negative
Okay
with
those
labels
stated
what
is
conditional
probability
What
I
wanted
to
consider
are
things
like
for
example
the
probability
of
cold
bar
plus
oh
what's
going
on
Now
the
vertical
bar
that
we
have
here
means
given
so
this
is
red
What
is
the
probability
that
you
have
covert
19
Given
That
you
tell
everything
clears
tougher
Ok
You
can
always
ask
me
to
pause
and
Alex
planes
has
been
positive
In
other
words
we
want
to
know
if
you
go
out
and
you
get
this
positive
result
what
is
the
probability
that
you
actually
have
it
That's
what
this
conditional
probability
is
representing
as
a
whole
bunch
of
different
conditional
probabilities
for
example
another
one
is
what
is
the
chance
that
your
disease
free
If
you
test
positive
this
would
be
a
false
positive
It
saying
you
test
positive
but
you
don't
actually
have
an
you
are
disease
free
So
that's
another
thing
I'd
be
really
interested
in
knowing
Likewise
you
can
ask
what
is
the
probability
that
you
have
Colvin
19
despite
the
fact
that
you
test
negative
that's
a
false
negative
And
then
finally
we
can
ask
what's
the
probability
that
your
disease-free
given
that
you
test
negative
all
of
these
numbers
are
between
01
or
100%
So
how
do
you
compute
conditional
probabilities
Well
one
of
the
most
powerful
tools
that
we
have
is
called
Bayes
theorem
And
Bayes
theorem
is
a
way
to
relate
one
kind
of
conditional
probability
with
a
nother
So
on
the
left-hand
side
this
P
of
a
given
B
I'm
just
using
a
generic
AMB
right
now
This
is
the
probability
that
a
is
true
given
that
you
know
that
B
is
true
And
sometimes
conditional
probabilities
or
no
one
easily
compute
it
sometimes
they're
challenging
Now
the
power
of
Bayes
theorem
is
that
this
conditional
probability
on
the
left
that
you
wanted
to
compute
Well
you
can
relate
this
to
the
probability
of
B
given
a
That
is
you
swapped
the
order
around
instead
of
being
given
B
and
asking
the
probability
of
a
we're
doing
a
and
asked
the
probability
of
B
Sometimes
one
or
the
other
of
these
might
be
easier
And
indeed
Bayes
theorem
gives
this
nice
result
The
other
expressions
P
of
a
and
P
of
B
This
is
just
what
the
generic
probability
of
either
a
or
b
if
you
don't
know
anything
else
Now
I
have
a
whole
video
introducing
this
theorem
proving
it
from
some
element
It
is
convenient
to
remember
when
you
look
at
it
You
can
see
when
you
look
at
it
in
a
mathematical
way
you
will
notice
that
we
can
always
write
that
probability
of
a
given
B
times
probability
of
B
is
equal
to
the
probability
of
B
given
a
times
the
probability
of
This
is
sometimes
a
useful
way
to
remember
What
Bayes
theorem
gives
you
Three
theorems
in
conditional
probability
And
you
can
check
the
link
in
the
description
for
that
if
you
wish
But
we're
going
to
use
it
for
this
business
of
testing
Okay
Let
me
return
the
names
that
leads
to
what
we
were
talking
about
before
with
Coburn
19
or
read
disease-free
interesting
positive
we're
testing
negative
This
is
just
Bayes
Theorem
stated
with
those
variables
So
in
this
case
I
am
asking
if
you
test
positive
what
is
the
chance
that
you
actually
have
the
disease
Now
there's
a
numerator
and
a
denominator
in
this
expression
So
if
I
hope
it's
just
an
enumerator
what's
going
on
here
This
is
a
product
of
two
probabilities
And
one
of
the
facts
of
probabilities
is
that
for
independent
events
multiplication
of
probabilities
is
basically
saying
what's
the
probability
that
both
of
these
things
are
true
at
the
same
time
it's
an
unstable
So
the
numerator
is
saying
what
is
the
probability
that
I
both
have
Coven
19
and
then
I
test
for
Coven
19
Now
if
I
then
focus
on
the
denominator
what's
the
probability
that
I
test
positive
with
especially
the
complicated
the
probability
that
you
test
positive
actually
depends
on
two
different
cases
There's
one
case
which
is
where
you
have
the
disease
and
then
you
test
positive
And
then
there's
another
case
which
is
the
false
positive
case
which
is
you
do
not
have
the
disease
but
you
still
test
positive
nevertheless
And
what
is
this
What
is
this
p
what
is
p
of
If
we
think
about
what
will
learn
class
time
Is
it
a
joint
isn't
a
marginal
probability
is
a
conditional
probability
Conditional
probability
b
of
a
is
the
probability
of
say
it
again
Please
Join
Such
EBIT
complicated
Yes
Things
are
true
at
the
same
time
it's
an
unstable
So
the
numerator
is
saying
what
is
the
probability
that
both
have
Coburn
19
and
then
I
test
for
Coven
acting
Now
if
I
then
focus
on
the
denominator
what's
the
probability
that
I
test
positive
with
such
a
complicated
The
probability
that
you
test
positive
actually
depends
on
two
different
cases
There's
one
case
which
is
where
you
have
the
disease
and
then
thinking
about
it
and
thinking
about
the
table
It
is
possible
it
is
possible
to
be
tested
to
positive
or
negative
right
One
row
could
be
for
positive
and
other
row
could
be
for
negative
Now
if
one
was
tested
and
got
the
result
that
is
positive
it
could
be
true
positives
or
false
positive
So
what
we
have
is
what
we
have
is
positive
It's
like
my
positive
negative
Now
positive
is
the
result
of
testing
and
negative
is
the
result
So
this
is
the
result
And
this
is
what
is
true
What
is
true
So
you
could
be
while
your
test
is
positive
it
can
be
true
or
false
When
you
result
is
negative
Again
it's
possible
that
it
is
true
or
false
right
So
in
this
case
we're
talking
about
the
whole
row
which
is
the
marginal
permeabilities
someone
noticed
right
You
test
positive
There's
another
case
which
is
the
false
positive
case
which
is
you
do
not
have
the
disease
but
you
still
test
positive
Nevertheless
in
Bayes
theorem
is
sometimes
called
the
bucket
problem
And
this
denominator
can
basically
be
split
into
these
two
different
cases
So
what
do
you
do
that
what
you
get
is
something
slightly
more
complicated
here
That
expression
who
had
been
broken
up
a
bit
the
numerator
exactly
the
same
But
in
the
denominator
you
break
it
up
into
these
two
different
cases
The
left
of
the
two
cases
is
the
probability
that
you
have
Govind
19
and
test
positive
And
the
right
one
in
the
denominator
is
the
probability
that
you
do
not
that
you
are
disease-free
but
nevertheless
you
test
positive
So
the
denominator
is
being
broken
up
into
these
two
different
cases
Now
Now
when
you
study
the
probability
it
is
very
important
right
from
the
beginning
to
understand
this
notation
If
not
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
move
on
There
is
a
lot
to
this
And
yet
when
you
think
about
it
sometimes
you
want
to
forget
about
the
notation
Close
your
eyes
and
just
think
about
the
example
that
we
looked
at
that
was
described
when
the
results
come
out
positive
Not
necessarily
when
you
are
indeed
sick
when
you
indeed
habit
it
could
be
false
positive
So
this
is
a
combination
One
is
a
true
positive
the
other
one
is
a
false
positive
Both
times
the
test
came
out
positive
In
one
case
it
is
true
In
the
other
case
it
is
false
I
do
want
to
be
clear
I'm
a
math
professor
I'm
not
an
epidemiologist
or
a
biologist
or
a
medical
doctor
So
I'm
not
trying
to
make
actual
predictions
about
the
prevalence
of
Coburn
19
in
society
But
I'm
just
gonna
make
up
a
toy
example
that
hopefully
you
believe
within
the
ballpark
of
being
some
real
numbers
So
how
will
this
Let's
imagine
that
I
have
a
test
that
is
95%
sense
of
99%
specific
and
that
the
prevalence
of
the
disease
is
1%
in
the
population
So
if
this
video
was
made
was
made
in
me
So
at
that
0
1%
was
kind
of
more
or
less
reasonable
And
right
now
it's
way
higher
but
didn't
know
And
these
numbers
are
representing
an
actual
Tesco
from
disease
But
nevertheless
we
have
a
good
toy
example
Okay
so
let's
look
into
again
I
want
to
interrupt
If
you
notice
he
used
the
word
toy
example
He
made
a
very
small
very
simple
example
Just
for
the
sake
of
showing
Sometimes
when
I
asked
you
to
test
something
I
will
use
this
word
a
toy
example
That
means
I
want
you
to
create
your
own
example
That
is
relatively
simple
It's
not
necessarily
true
data
if
you
can
take
it
from
somewhere
that's
fine
If
not
you're
just
making
up
your
own
very
simple
example
that
is
very
easy
to
compute
without
using
some
program
So
when
you
write
your
program
and
you
get
the
result
you
can
compare
with
your
computation
And
you
know
whether
it's
true
or
not
When
you
are
going
through
your
through
your
programming
courses
tangible
14
you
had
to
test
your
programs
right
So
sometimes
you
would
end
up
writing
a
simple
example
where
you
would
know
what
the
outcome
should
be
and
then
you
would
compare
with
what
your
programs
want
to
give
you
right
So
in
this
case
you're
going
to
do
something
that
is
very
similar
You
cannot
trust
the
program
You
cannot
just
write
several
lines
Expect
that
program
to
give
you
the
correct
output
Maybe
you
did
something
wrong
on
the
way
and
then
all
your
results
are
going
to
be
wrong
So
no
matter
how
simple
or
complicated
your
program
is
always
create
a
toy
example
in
test
formula
Well
the
first
thing
I'm
going
to
see
is
that
I
have
the
probability
of
having
Govind
19
into
different
places
Here
if
there's
a
1%
prevalence
among
the
population
what
I'm
saying
is
that
poor
people
are
random
as
a
1%
chance
that
they
actually
have
it
then
the
peak
of
Coburn
19
is
worth
0
points
or
a
one
So
obviously
replaces
those
numbers
with
0
01
I
didn't
see
two
places
where
I
have
the
probability
of
testing
positive
if
you're
given
coordinates
Now
this
is
in
my
data
as
well
I
said
that
we
have
a
95%
sensitive
test
and
those
statements
are
conditional
probabilities
The
statement
that
it
is
95%
sensitive
means
that
95%
of
the
time
when
you're
given
that
you
have
coronavirus
you're
gonna
guess
has
positive
word
So
both
of
these
numbers
are
0
95
and
I
can
plug
those
in
as
well
Okay
two
more
to
go
I
have
the
probability
that
you
test
positive
given
that
you're
actually
disease
free
These
were
the
false
positives
You
don't
have
the
disease
but
you
still
test
positive
The
fact
that
our
test
is
99%
specific
means
that
this
value
is
going
to
be
0
01
The
chance
you
test
positive
is
by
not
having
the
disease
is
just
1%
of
the
time
because
it's
99%
specific
And
then
finally
what's
the
probability
that
you
don't
have
the
disease
Well
if
you
didn't
know
anything
else
and
you
said
1%
of
the
population
hasn't
a
99
therefore
does
not
You'd
put
in
0
99
year
put
out
all
those
numbers
and
you
can
approximately
0
49
or
approximately
50%
These
decimals
we
multiply
by
102
convert
to
percents
They'll
actually
seems
surprising
Perhaps
We
start
with
a
test
that
is
99%
specific
In
other
words
it's
going
to
very
very
low
rate
of
false
positives
And
yet
you
get
this
positive
result
in
only
half
the
time
you
actually
have
the
disease
will
why
would
that
be
Well
the
issue
is
the
prevalence
of
the
disease
is
so
rare
is
this
ID
if
you
assumed
it
having
1%
And
the
result
of
this
is
that
the
false
positive
rate
cannons
to
be
almost
as
large
as
the
actual
rate
or
prevalence
itself
And
that
sort
of
a
50-50
chance
right
I'm
going
to
stop
this
video
right
here
If
you
want
you
can
finish
watching
it
And
we're
going
to
go
over
another
theorem
today
or
Markov
chains
today
And
I
would
advise
you
to
watch
his
video
on
market
trends
as
well
We're
not
going
to
do
it
in
class
but
if
you
want
to
do
you
can
always
do
it
later
I
like
that
one
to
this
is
just
a
formula
And
if
I
gave
you
this
simple
formula
and
a
simple
Even
if
I
supplied
this
simple
example
you
would
have
left
this
class
with
known
close
to
what
you
knew
before
the
class
That's
how
it
works
was
based
theorem
At
least
from
my
experience
it
is
complicated
enough
and
simple
enough
to
where
it
seems
like
you
understand
it
in
yet
You
have
no
clue
how
to
use
Unless
you
think
about
it
The
way
he
explained
This
is
another
example
It's
a
very
close
example
to
what
was
just
covered
in
a
video
I
think
you
should
look
at
this
example
and
just
maybe
covered
the
solution
and
see
if
you
can
solve
it
and
get
the
same
outcome
Okay
Now
I
will
try
to
be
consistent
and
I
will
try
given
your
quizzes
on
Fridays
we'll
see
how
it
works
But
this
Friday
I'm
going
to
give
you
a
quiz
that
will
be
on
bees
in
Bayes
theorem
and
Markov
chains
To
try
to
look
through
this
stuff
In
the
next
couple
of
days
And
remarkable
Russian
mathematician
let's
look
at
the
following
problem
Let's
look
at
the
weather
Spring
term
whether
there
are
three
possibilities
Nice
rainy
snowy
If
it
is
nice
today
then
tomorrow
Seventy-five
percent
will
be
earning
25%
We'll
be
snow
That's
If
it
is
nice
to
d
If
it
is
rainy
today
Tomorrow
could
be
rainy
or
snowy
25%
will
be
rainy
twenty-five
percent
will
be
nice
weather
and
50%
that
it
will
be
slower
And
finally
even
if
it's
snowy
today
then
tomorrow
could
be
brainy
nice
personnel
Only
if
it
is
nice
tomorrow
can't
be
nice
Okay
Now
our
question
or
questions
are
going
to
be
to
predict
the
weather
The
weather
today
What
is
the
percent
of
this
this
or
this
kind
of
weather
tomorrow
If
to
date
is
this
or
that
Then
after
we're
done
with
that
we
can
move
two
steps
What
we
know
today
and
asked
whether
what's
going
to
be
two
days
after
today
What
about
three
days
four
days
And
so
how
are
we
going
to
do
In
this
case
We
have
three
states
Nice
snowy
Snowy
entering
We
have
three
states
How
are
they
connected
Alright
to
connect
we
use
information
from
here
For
example
for
nice
we
will
have
an
arrow
to
rainy
and
snowy
The
arrow
to
rainy
will
have
75%
on
it
What
does
it
mean
Nice
Snowy
If
it
is
raining
If
it
has
nice
Today
it's
75%
that
it
will
be
rainy
tomorrow
And
it
is
25%
for
that
It
will
be
rainy
Snowy
tomorrow
So
when
I
am
here
I
will
wake
up
tomorrow
for
sure
So
it
is
100%
that
I
will
observe
something
tomorrow
Well
if
not
me
than
someone
else
So
it
is
a
100%
total
I
will
split
this
a
100%
among
the
states
that
I
can
get
tomorrow
There
are
two
possible
states
rainy
and
snowy
Rainy
was
seventy-five
percent
snow
with
25
That's
how
it
works
Different
a
different
situation
with
Rainey
because
if
we
have
raining
we
can
take
we
can
stay
in
the
same
state
With
some
trends
in
we
can
move
to
the
other
two
states
So
in
this
case
we
have
this
self-loop
because
we
can
stay
here
with
25%
And
then
we
have
two
errors
Want
to
snowy
in
one
to
the
nice
weather
I
thought
when
he
put
to
replace
the
question
on
the
tragedy
is
something
related
to
reading
Any
questions
so
far
No
All
right
So
if
it
is
nice
to
date
there
is
seventy-five
percent
of
chance
that
tomorrow
is
bringing
What
if
I
want
to
find
the
probability
of
tomorrow
being
snowing
If
today's
Nice
okay
that's
25
However
what
if
I
want
to
find
the
probability
of
tomorrow
the
day
after
tomorrow
I
need
to
put
a
little
more
effort
into
it
Let's
look
This
is
a
matrix
that
is
sometimes
called
transition
probabilities
We
have
the
same
information
here
is
what
was
here
and
what
was
here
for
the
same
information
just
is
a
written
in
the
form
of
a
matrix
The
probability
of
going
from
nice
to
nice
is
0
The
probability
of
going
from
nice
to
rainy
is
075
Nice
Rainy
is
075
This
is
how
we
obtained
this
matrix
In
general
It
is
how
you
will
move
from
this
t
t
minus
one
to
the
state
t
So
this
matrix
reflect
one
move
It
doesn't
have
to
be
from
today
to
tomorrow
It
can
be
a
100
days
from
now
Our
question
is
what
is
the
probability
that
it
will
be
nice
for
the
day
After
tomorrow
If
it
is
nice
to
date
So
if
today
is
for
example
a
state
0
or
d
0
let's
put
it
that
way
If
the
d
is
d
0
what
is
the
probability
that
on
day
two
It
will
be
nice
Nice
today
As
you
can
understand
as
you
already
started
sensing
we
need
to
multiply
this
matrices
If
you
multiply
the
matrices
then
the
resulting
matrix
is
going
to
give
you
the
probabilities
of
the
Dien
Bien
nice
Raining
or
sunny
in
two
days
In
general
if
you
raise
your
matrix
into
the
power
of
n
is
going
to
give
you
a
probability
matrix
that
will
tell
you
what
weather
is
going
to
be
In
days
It's
not
going
to
give
you
what
we're
going
to
give
you
the
probabilities
for
each
state
with
an
n
days
in
and
days
What
it
consists
of
Each
of
this
intrigued
How
do
you
compute
one
entry
of
a
matrix
when
you
multiply
the
matrices
How
How
do
you
do
this
How
do
you
multiply
matrices
How
do
you
find
this
intriguing
Row
and
column
of
row
and
column
right
Please
review
this
Please
review
it
I
understand
that
we
forget
forget
what
we
don't
use
That's
fine
Just
put
a
note
somewhere
in
review
how
to
multiply
matrices
So
rho
by
a
column
It
doesn't
mean
that
we
take
a
row
and
we
came
up
with
some
operation
that
multiplies
rows
by
columns
But
this
is
how
it
is
easier
to
remember
a
row
by
a
column
Of
course
we
do
not
multiply
rows
by
columns
We
take
each
element
from
a
row
and
multiplied
by
the
corresponding
element
from
the
from
the
calm
So
the
first
times
the
first
plus
the
second
times
the
second
plus
the
third
times
the
third
All
right
Okay
So
that
is
going
to
be
this
number
If
you
look
at
the
process
then
you
will
understand
why
we
do
that
What
exactly
do
we
do
The
probability
to
go
from
nice
to
read
is
0
75
What
is
the
probability
that
I
will
go
from
nice
to
rain
And
on
the
next
day
to
study
What
is
the
probability
If
today
is
nice
in
two
days
will
be
sunny
What
is
the
probability
I
didn't
mean
to
ask
you
the
exact
number
Of
course
here
you
are
using
a
calculator
but
how
did
you
get
it
What
I
want
is
the
probability
of
two
D
being
nice
in
today's
being
sunny
tomorrow
being
green
rainy
So
the
reader
condition
I
want
to
go
from
north
from
nice
to
rainy
to
sunny
I'm
not
just
saying
today
is
nice
and
in
today's
sunny
So
we
need
to
treat
the
twenty-five
percent
of
half
from
50%
path
from
R
to
S
right
I
think
it
is
a
075
Make
the
errors
or
not
Ok
so
we
need
to
take
this
path
and
we
need
to
take
of
that
path
what
we're
going
to
have
a
0
75
times
0
5
So
if
we
go
from
nice
to
sunny
rainy
we
multiply
0
75
by
0
5
And
a
which
is
three
terms
right
Three
terms
It
tells
us
how
did
you
get
to
each
state
From
each
state
How
can
we
get
from
here
to
there
First
by
going
to
rainy
first
and
then
Sony
second
by
stain
here
and
then
sunny
By
going
to
the
state
instant
here
right
There
are
three
possible
ways
only
three
ways
And
these
are
the
three
terms
that
are
reflected
in
our
product
Look
The
first
one
is
0
times
0
It
says
if
you
want
to
go
to
sunny
by
staying
in
mice
first
It's
a
0
probability
because
you
can't
take
a
today's
unless
now
if
you
want
to
go
to
rain
and
then
sunny
it's
this
case
This
by
this
And
finally
if
you
want
to
go
to
sunny
and
then
the
second
day
stay
in
sunny
It
is
this
which
is
this
one
By
this
which
is
backed
away
That's
why
this
entry
represents
the
probability
of
B
in
today's
after
today
If
today
is
nice
you
can
compute
the
probability
of
being
in
a
particular
state
Nice
raining
or
sunny
whatever
the
number
of
days
And
you
want
by
multiplying
this
matrix
by
itself
as
many
times
as
you
need
This
is
what
Markov
chains
are
about
and
that's
what
they
allow
you
to
do
Other

of
interesting

Yes
Markov

are
very
