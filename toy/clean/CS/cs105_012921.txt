And
maybe
we
can
start
with
questions
if
you
have
them
right
now
Just
about
this
problem
do
you
have
any
specific
questions
So
we
calculate
this
chi-squared
that
it's
supposed
to
tell
us
the
correlation
correct
Like
the
strength
of
the
correlation
O
we
will
get
there
we'll
get
there
Who
didn't
even
touch
that
yet
Yeah
German
church
you
know
just
the
set-up
and
what
question
while
you
were
answering
in
what
is
the
null
hypothesis
What
is
the
alternative
hypothesis
What
we
covered
last
time
for
now
That's
more
or
less
clear
Alright
So
we
have
data
1500
people
we're
serving
the
Jamnagar
And
what's
the
type
of
literature
they
prefer
was
recorded
Our
data
is
right
here
without
parentheses
to
5050
to
101
thousand
This
is
our
data
We
wanted
to
answer
a
question
about
the
preferences
as
far
as
they're
reading
It
is
gender
specific
Now
our
null
hypothesis
is
right
here
These
two
attributes
are
independent
Our
alternative
hypothesis
these
two
attributes
are
correlated
Like
we
said
before
we
don't
know
if
one
depends
on
the
other
but
we
can
have
the
answer
to
the
question
with
some
probability
whether
they
are
correlated
or
not
Null
hypothesis
two
attributes
are
independent
We
are
going
to
try
to
see
that
it
is
a
high
probability
with
the
hypermobility
we
can
say
yes
they
are
independent
or
we
can
reject
this
hypothesis
If
we
reject
this
hypothesis
we
will
see
with
the
probability
of
for
example
for
example
5%
we
are
wrong
We
rejected
this
hypothesis
And
with
the
probability
of
let's
say
5%
we
made
a
mistake
by
rejecting
it
If
you've
seen
before
this
information
in
this
process
we
can
make
two
types
of
mistakes
Sometimes
they're
called
type
one
or
alpha
and
type
two
or
type
one
mistake
rejecting
the
null
hypothesis
mistakenly
And
given
false
positive
study
results
So
we
reject
mistakenly
we
should
know
And
type
two
as
you
can
guess
we
failed
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis
when
we
should
have
rejected
o
right
We're
going
to
compute
chi-square
worker
efficient
To
start
with
There
is
nothing
difficult
here
You're
just
taken
the
sum
across
each
data
0
1234
entry
interests
here
and
we're
going
to
have
four
terms
That
will
be
four
terms
It's
going
to
be
just
because
we're
going
to
sum
across
the
rows
and
the
columns
Now
what
is
this
expression
This
expression
is
going
to
tell
me
the
relative
distance
of
expected
value
from
the
observed
value
The
further
the
expected
value
from
the
observed
value
the
higher
the
probability
is
that
these
events
are
dependent
Right
So
we're
going
to
measure
this
difference
When
I'm
seen
difference
you
can
see
right
here
that
it
is
the
difference
squared
divided
by
the
expected
value
But
what
the
idea
of
the
meaning
of
it
we
wanted
to
see
how
far
one
is
one
from
another
They
are
very
very
close
then
probably
the
null
hypothesis
is
correct
that
these
attributes
are
in
Japan
If
we
expect
if
we
expected
approximately
which
we
received
Okay
So
we
have
our
observed
values
and
we
need
to
compute
our
expected
values
Of
course
when
you
have
this
formula
in
front
of
your
eyes
it
is
very
easy
to
do
so
Well
in
this
case
the
contact
male
times
the
current
of
fiction
for
the
first
entry
divided
But
the
total
So
after
we've
computed
all
these
values
we
find
chi-square
We
found
this
chi-square
coefficient
Now
we
need
to
analyze
the
value
of
this
chi-square
coefficient
First
we
need
to
find
the
degrees
of
freedom
of
our
data
The
formula
is
simple
The
number
of
rows
minus
one
times
the
number
of
cones
minus1
I
also
explained
to
you
last
time
what
it
means
and
why
it
is
the
number
of
rows
minus
one
and
the
number
of
columns
minus
one
We're
not
going
to
go
any
deeper
into
this
but
if
you
want
you
can
either
read
or
we
can
talk
about
it
In
our
case
we
have
two
rows
two
columns
So
the
degrees
of
freedom
is
going
to
be
two
minus
one
times
two
minus
one
which
is
one
Right
now
We
can
use
the
following
table
The
degree
of
freedom
is
right
here
That's
the
degree
of
freedom
Here
How
important
for
us
or
what
probability
we
are
okay
with
If
we
want
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis
and
be
mistakenly
or
mistakenly
reject
this
null
hypothesis
Okay
So
if
we
reject
the
null
hypothesis
the
recent
probability
that
when
made
the
mistake
what
is
this
probability
We
are
OK
to
live
with
The
smallest
one
The
smallest
value
is
0
001
This
is
the
smallest
n
this
term
So
if
our
value
and
as
you
can
see
it
is
this
value
is
10
something
and
our
value
was
fully
greater
than
that
500
If
our
value
is
greater
than
this
film
then
we
are
ready
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis
In
this
case
this
is
the
smallest
possible
probability
of
rejecting
and
being
drawn
I
can
reject
with
this
probability
this
this
this
this
this
is
a
higher
probability
that
I'm
wrong
if
I'm
rejecting
the
null
hypothesis
You
can
see
this
distance
between
the
observed
and
expected
value
right
here
is
small
Again
when
I'm
seeing
distance
I
don't
really
mean
one
minus
the
error
according
to
the
formula
Is
that
more
or
less
clear
So
I
I
will
tell
you
I
am
okay
with
say
5%
Our
probability
that
i
am
wrong
if
I
reject
the
null
hypothesis
I'm
looking
at
the
5%
value
in
this
chirp
and
compare
the
value
that
is
the
lowest
that
I
can
reject
What
If
my
value
is
higher
than
this
value
Then
I
will
fit
this
5%
March
It's
time
for
you
to
tell
me
something
Instead
Instead
of
going
out
in
maybe
pulling
people
individually
you
just
put
the
poll
out
there
and
send
a
message
to
a
large
group
of
people
Maybe
I'm
like
social
media
I'm
gonna
necessarily
not
necessarily
just
look
at
this
word
crowd
sourcing
Yes
What
else
Crowd
sourcing
information
Data
is
created
by
crowd
Alright
so
you
will
look
and
be
ready
to
name
It
lists
5-7
sources
that
we
can
consider
to
be
bill
sources
that
are
created
by
crap
You
will
tell
me
later
about
this
If
I
ask
you
for
example
in
the
midterm
But
when
you
think
about
this
term
crowd-sourcing
you
will
think
about
some
something
that
is
done
on
internet
right
And
you
would
be
surprised
to
where
the
notion
of
crown
sources
and
current
sources
in
when
it
started
It
started
actually
in
I
believe
19
0-6
And
it
began
with
an
ox
For
something
like
this
guy
There
was
a
scientist
Francis
Galton
who
was
a
relative
of
Charles
Darwin
You
all
know
Charles
Darwin
but
for
some
reason
we
don't
know
Francis
Galton
and
he's
the
founder
of
statistical
signs
maybe
some
of
our
statisticians
and
class
notice
me
He
attended
livestock
fair
The
villages
where
asked
to
guess
the
weight
of
a
particular
ox
which
is
guessing
who
ever
would
come
closer
to
the
weight
would
get
some
prize
Of
course
as
people
were
all
over
with
the
weight
that
were
very
different
numbers
But
when
they
collected
all
this
data
in
phone
to
the
mean
of
it
the
mean
was
very
very
close
to
the
weight
of
the
guide
was
1178
pounds
and
the
mean
was
1179
So
you
can
see
how
incredibly
great
that
is
that
the
rule
Sometimes
it
works
wonders
Sometimes
you
may
use
even
if
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
your
question
you
may
ask
the
crowd
to
answer
your
question
and
then
find
the
mean
average
or
the
median
depending
on
what
you're
looking
for
But
you
can
try
to
get
the
information
from
Crown
What
I
would
like
us
to
try
doing
right
now
here's
a
bottle
of
orange
juice
Bottle
It's
I
don't
know
I
can't
see
like
maybe
about
one
liter
maybe
a
little
bit
more
in
such
bottle
And
you
can
see
the
coins
right
here
but
pennies
You
can
try
to
imagine
that
bottle
the
size
of
the
size
of
a
penny
You
can
increase
the
size
of
the
screen
You
can
try
to
imagine
the
number
cubic
centimeter
and
then
multiply
by
what
you
think
is
going
to
be
the
volume
of
this
part
of
the
bottle
So
anything
is
fine
I'd
like
you
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
number
of
pennies
in
this
bottom
I'll
give
you
maybe
a
couple
of
minutes
for
that
And
then
do
you
know
your
number
on
I
learned
If
you
don't
I'll
just
ask
it
to
go
on
Google
Drive
I
created
a
document
for
you
to
put
your
number
just
on
the
next
available
room
After
that
we
will
ask
someone
to
find
the
mean
So
first
I'm
going
to
give
you
two
minutes
to
finger
When
you're
ready
I
will
ask
you
to
type
that
number
And
then
we'll
find
the
mean
and
we'll
see
if
we're
close
or
not
Okay
Go
oh
professor
Document
is
the
only
it's
on
Google
Drive
Now
what
we
can
see
the
document
view
only
We
can't
edit
it
Oh
it's
you
only
I
certainly
if
tempted
Yeah
Right
Be
reasonable
numbers
okay
don't
just
type
random
numbers
thinking
about
it
Guys
just
remember
don't
type
random
numbers
Try
to
analyze
what
some
dead
bottle
what
can
be
there
How
is
that
not
random
if
we
have
no
data
You
do
you
can
imagine
the
bottle
not
type
random
numbers
I
think
your
type
and
just
some
of
your
type
and
random
numbers
Can
we
go
with
the
volume
of
a
penny
But
you
don't
need
to
try
to
just
imagine
how
many
pennies
you're
going
to
have
an
a
cubit
I
don't
know
either
centimeter
or
two-by-two
centimeters
which
is
going
to
be
that
What
I
did
was
I
looked
online
like
how
many
pennies
are
in
a
jar
and
I
visually
and
they
told
me
they
answer
the
how
many
pennies
are
in
that
jar
Kind
of
gauge
What
I
saw
in
line
What
I'm
saying
here
to
make
my
estimation
That's
fine
to
do
the
machine
learning
on
yourself
You
want
our
student
IDs
next
to
our
guests
Oh
no
no
no
Of
course
not
You
shouldn't
be
showing
you
a
student
IDs
to
anyone
Except
for
me
Well
I
wasn't
sure
because
there
was
a
bunch
of
them
on
the
dock
No
no
no
no
no
no
When
I
sit
and
I
learned
I
just
meant
that
order
so
you
don't
collide
in
rows
Sometimes
two
people
may
try
to
edit
the
same
row
Number
13
You
mister
you
deliberately
didn't
want
to
put
anything
And
then
2529
and
we're
done
Are
you
ready
to
finish
Didn't
put
enough
effort
into
the
entire
course
I
don't
think
any
one
of
us
can
speak
to
the
completion
of
the
entire
class
So
I'm
just
talking
I'm
just
asking
you
if
somebody
says
no
I'm
not
done
That
means
when
I'm
done
So
those
that
were
trying
completed
right
Okay
Now
somebody
please
include
the
valuable
There
are
more
coming
Include
the
values
from
the
last
rows
into
the
missing
rows
Instead
Just
copy
them
and
find
the
average
Oh
I
got
the
average
right
here
143343
No-no
Eight
it
says
right
here
843
36
coins
Yeah
843
Yes
We
failed
the
test
Wait
we
don't
know
yet
because
how
much
do
you
have
I
answered
by
a
lot
Do
you
want
me
double-dot
isn't
it
Okay
I'm
going
to
delete
all
this
data
And
I'm
going
to
give
you
one
more
chance
Where
instead
of
guessing
because
I
notice
that
I
ask
you
a
question
and
I
noticed
some
numbers
started
showing
up
That
means
those
students
were
guessing
simply
I
didn't
ask
you
to
guess
Remember
I
asked
you
to
reason
about
it
because
guess
and
it's
not
going
to
do
anything
So
I
will
delete
it
and
I
will
give
you
one
more
chance
Alright
here
we
go
You
can
even
count
the
number
If
you
look
at
the
front
right
you
know
the
number
is
way
more
than
what
To
some
students
at
typing
Hey
okay
Okay
Okay
Did
you
give
a
specification
for
the
volume
of
the
bottle
or
is
that
supposed
to
be
unknown
I
didn't
give
a
specification
but
you
should
be
able
to
imagine
the
regular
bottle
of
orange
juice
to
get
to
answers
Thank
you
Any
more
answers
They
were
more
before
Last
chance
Yes-no
Everybody's
done
Please
copy
from
the
bottom
rows
up
or
I
didn't
know
As
long
as
you
divide
by
the
correct
number
it
doesn't
matter
It
looks
like
the
new
averages
1900
then
you
average
is
nineteen
hundred
Nineteen
hundred
I'll
tell
you
the
exact
number
I
was
close
That
was
very
close
I'm
surprised
You
didn't
know
you
didn't
see
any
information
about
this
You
didn't
see
the
steps
before
Next
time
I'll
make
my
own
Jarvis
paintings
I
was
going
to
but
in
this
covered
world
you
don't
know
where
to
go
where
to
get
stuff
Well
it's
actually
it's
kind
of
like
one
of
the
entries
is
4500
All
right
So
I
think
they
really
wanted
to
push
the
average
They
were
mad
at
the
group
It's
possible
for
someone
I
didn't
see
Oh
I
think
I
think
that
treated
it
before
I
did
the
average
function
So
sometimes
you
may
want
to
delete
Outliers
look
at
outliers
from
both
sides
But
I
didn't
know
I'm
surprised
I've
never
seen
I
did
this
test
last
quarter
We
didn't
have
as
close
Wasn't
that
bad
but
it
was
really
close
right
now
So
you
think
that
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
ask
everybody
and
then
tried
to
find
some
meaningful
information
You
would
be
surprised
Sometimes
it
works
but
you
need
to
know
that
cases
when
it
does
when
it
does
Okay
So
I'm
going
to
let
you
go
I
entertained
you
a
little
bit
right
now
Hope
you
didn't
