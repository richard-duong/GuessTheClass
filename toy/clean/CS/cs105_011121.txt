This
is
where
we
stopped
last
time
We
need
to
look
over
the
correlation
I'm
sure
you
know
how
to
compute
correlation
It's
not
maybe
unique
to
review
In
any
case
it
is
not
a
complicated
process
Suppose
we
have
two
variables
x
and
y
represented
by
a
simple
of
end
points
of
the
form
x
i
y
i
where
i
is
between
110
X
is
correlated
to
y
or
y
is
correlated
to
x
or
x
and
y
are
correlated
when
the
value
of
x
look
at
this
has
some
predictive
power
on
the
value
of
y
Which
means
if
we
know
x
then
there
is
a
way
to
predict
a
y
Then
there
correlate
Now
sometimes
this
word
correlation
is
used
loosely
correlated
one
depends
on
the
other
Now
it
doesn't
mean
that
It
doesn't
mean
that
if
two
variables
are
correlated
then
one
depends
on
the
other
We
will
talk
about
that
in
a
second
But
before
we
go
also
you
need
to
remember
some
times
correlated
means
that
indeed
why
can
be
predicted
from
x
but
not
necessarily
linearly
Sometimes
correlation
is
meant
as
a
linear
correlation
And
sometimes
this
word
is
used
in
when
there
is
a
correlation
of
any
type
Usually
a
book
that
uses
the
word
correlation
Usually
they
defined
which
way
they're
going
to
use
We're
going
to
talk
about
linear
currently
We're
going
to
talk
about
linear
correlation
On
these
three
pictures
you
can
see
a
positive
correlation
If
and
if
x
grows
y
grows
linearly
with
x
Negative
correlation
If
x
grows
the
value
of
y
goes
down
linearly
with
Y
and
no
correlation
we
cannot
predict
y
if
we
know
X
As
we
said
before
just
because
we
see
this
picture
or
that
picture
just
because
two
variables
are
correlated
It
does
not
mean
that
one
depends
on
the
other
What
could
be
the
possibility
First
confounding
variables
You
collect
data
on
sandbars
in
ice
cream
consumption
You
find
that
ice
cream
consumption
is
associated
with
a
higher
probability
of
sunburn
Does
that
mean
that
ice
cream
consumption
causes
sunburns
Will
obviously
with
this
data
yeah
So
what
does
it
mean
Ice
cream
causes
Sandberg
Somebody
says
No
Somebody
says
Yes
explain
Explain
why
Explain
why
know
correlation
isn't
causation
But
that's
true
But
what
does
it
mean
to
be
no
because
just
because
ice
cream
consumption
has
is
correlated
with
sunburned
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
ice
cream
causes
sunburn
It
could
be
that
it's
really
hot
and
everyone
is
the
beach
and
they're
also
eating
ice
cream
But
this
is
so
hard
they
can
also
be
getting
sunburned
Okay
So
first
first
it
doesn't
mean
that
these
two
variables
are
variables
cause
one
another
Neither
ice
cream
causes
sunburn
No
ice
cream
necessarily
causes
the
high
consumption
consumption
of
ice
cream
Well
maybe
I'll
feel
more
like
eating
ice
cream
but
really
it's
not
what
causes
the
high
consumption
of
ice
cream
What
does
hot
temperatures
right
Hot
temperature
causes
both
It
causes
both
The
values
increases
at
the
same
time
The
value
simply
increases
at
the
same
time
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
one
is
caused
by
the
other
When
you
see
the
picture
when
you
see
some
sort
of
a
correlation
do
not
rush
into
drawn
a
conclusion
Do
not
immediately
conclude
that
one
is
caused
by
the
other
It
is
a
very
big
mistake
to
do
so
In
this
case
both
are
caused
by
a
confounding
variable
There
caused
by
another
variable
Which
could
be
another
picture
of
two
variables
growing
with
the
same
pattern
as
it
is
on
this
picture
Like
I
said
we
are
going
to
when
we're
using
correlation
in
our
class
we're
going
to
talk
about
linear
correlation
In
this
case
this
is
not
well
it
can't
be
looked
at
as
almost
linear
but
it's
not
really
But
the
point
that
we
want
to
make
here
that
correlation
does
not
mean
causation
I've
read
this
red
curve
is
total
revenue
generated
by
arcades
And
the
black
curve
Computer
science
doctorates
awarded
in
the
United
States
Are
they
really
that
coordinated
Well
they
are
But
simply
because
their
values
or
so
close
to
each
other
it
doesn't
mean
that
one
causes
the
other
Please
remember
that
Again
From
now
on
when
we
use
the
word
correlation
we
are
going
to
be
talking
about
linear
scaling
play
a
role
in
misleading
Well
I'm
not
sure
I
understand
the
question
of
can
scaling
play
a
role
in
misleading
correlations
like
how
the
data
is
presented
How
the
data
is
presented
of
course
can
play
a
role
You
can
always
what
we
will
talk
a
little
bit
we
will
talk
a
little
bit
about
it
And
also
I'm
going
to
suggest
a
book
later
on
just
to
remind
me
of
how
by
presenting
the
data
in
a
specific
way
you
can
mislead
the
reader
Data
is
a
very
powerful
tool
And
you
can
prove
anything
just
by
presenting
your
data
in
some
smart
to
this
awake
or
the
way
that
is
going
to
support
your
argument
no
matter
whether
your
argument
is
right
or
wrong
Alright
Computer
correlation
This
is
an
interesting
question
not
just
from
the
point
of
computer
correlation
but
for
your
main
b0
to
apply
in
practice
If
you
are
dealing
with
this
pedicle
Joan
is
an
investor
He's
portfolios
primarily
tracks
the
performance
the
S
and
P
500
And
John
wants
to
add
the
stock
of
Apple
Before
adding
Apple
to
his
portfolio
he
wants
to
assess
the
correlation
between
the
stalk
and
the
S
and
P
500
to
ensure
that
adding
this
talk
won't
increase
the
systematic
risk
of
his
portfolio
To
find
the
coefficient
John
gathers
the
falling
process
for
the
last
five
years
These
are
the
values
of
S
and
P
500
and
apples
How
to
compute
the
correlation
between
these
two
variables
This
is
the
formula
but
we
will
go
a
little
bit
slower
than
that
We
will
compute
the
mean
of
each
Next
We
need
to
compute
each
of
this
difference
and
each
of
this
difference
The
first
and
the
SEC
Just
the
difference
between
the
mean
And
the
value
itself
each
valued
so
all
right
that's
it
That's
this
one
And
next
is
their
product
Next
is
the
product
Find
the
sum
and
divide
by
the
square
root
of
the
squares
There
is
nothing
difficult
right
here
Besides
you
can
always
use
just
type
the
word
right
here
and
it's
good
to
do
it
for
you
Nevertheless
whatever
you're
using
you
should
know
how
it
works
and
you
should
know
the
formula
Because
if
you
see
this
value
doesn't
make
sense
you
need
to
understand
where
they're
coming
from
and
you
only
do
if
you
understand
how
it
works
So
if
you're
using
these
packages
Python
packages
I'm
fine
with
it
You
will
not
need
to
write
the
code
unless
you
want
to
unless
you
want
to
practice
But
you
still
need
to
know
exactly
how
it
works
Well
at
least
in
this
case
later
on
when
we
start
working
on
machine
learning
algorithms
Sometimes
I
will
tell
you
if
you
didn't
go
over
it
in
calculus
then
it's
OK
You
can
just
use
this
particular
function
All
right
The
answer
right
here
or
the
value
right
here
is
0
95
the
value
for
the
correlation
is
between
negative
11
We
will
see
and
define
a
little
bit
stricter
later
on
What
is
the
positive
negative
correlation
What
is
this
strong
correlation
in
weak
correlation
and
so
on
But
at
this
point
you
understand
that
if
the
value
is
very
close
to
one
it
means
a
strong
positive
correlation
And
if
the
value
is
close
to
negative
one
it
is
a
strong
negative
correlation
So
the
closer
to
one
the
stronger
the
correlation
What
does
it
mean
in
this
case
That
means
that
both
will
increase
the
values
or
decrease
the
values
at
the
same
time
Is
it
useful
this
trophy
correlating
right
One
is
going
to
increase
the
value
there
is
going
to
increase
develop
We're
not
going
to
know
the
reason
behind
it
What's
happened
there
We
don't
know
but
we
understand
that
if
he
adds
Apple
to
his
portfolio
what's
going
to
happen
In
other
words
should
he
or
should
he
not
It
looks
like
you'll
make
a
little
money
He
should
You'll
make
a
lot
of
money
Any
other
point
of
view
It's
highly
correlated
with
S
and
P
500
S&p
500s
will
go
down
What's
happened
to
Apple
Apple
will
also
go
down
go
down
Not
because
one
went
down
but
because
we
found
that
they're
correlated
strongly
correlated
one
goes
down
the
other
goes
down
What
happens
He
increases
He
increases
the
risk
He
increases
the
risk
So
as
you
guys
answered
on
chat
if
he
does
not
want
to
increase
the
risk
then
he
should
not
be
Apple
stocks
If
he
wants
to
decrease
the
risk
then
this
correlation
should
be
strongly
negative
Then
when
one
goes
down
the
other
one
will
go
up
Okay
Alright
It
a
little
bit
more
about
well
in
this
course
in
this
case
I
wouldn't
use
the
word
curly
correlation
but
some
dependence
on
the
other
First
Google
n-grams
I
advise
you
if
you
have
time
find
Google
n-grams
where
you
can
just
type
it
on
the
search
engine
In
fact
if
you
want
I
can
do
it
right
now
and
show
you
how
it
works
This
is
how
it
looks
Just
like
Google
n-grams
or
am
Graham
What
is
it
Google
decided
to
scan
all
of
the
world's
published
books
Of
course
it's
not
finished
right
now
Right
now
more
than
20%
of
all
books
that
were
published
to
a
scant
probably
most
frequently
read
book
of
the
well-known
books
But
they
in
this
process
Now
Google
n-grams
provide
the
frequency
with
which
word
or
a
short
phrase
for
curves
In
books
published
from
particularly
here
or
from
the
year
that
they
started
using
it
For
this
part
of
the
work
that
is
being
used
You
can
use
just
a
single
word
or
you
can
use
phrases
If
you
happen
to
use
a
phrase
that
is
not
there
that
is
not
shown
is
not
used
then
you
simply
will
not
find
a
high
usage
of
it
Or
you
may
find
a
0
if
it
is
a
phrase
that
was
never
used
but
there
is
no
harm
to
play
What
I
decided
to
use
right
here
on
this
picture
is
simply
three
words
Capitalism
socialism
and
communism
How
frequently
they've
been
used
And
just
by
looking
at
this
in
grams
how
they're
correlated
Again
in
this
case
correlated
I
don't
mean
linear
correlation
as
we
are
going
to
be
talking
about
Just
look
at
this
pattern
You
can
read
somewhat
of
a
history
just
by
looking
at
increase
or
decrease
relative
increase
or
decrease
both
at
particular
term
For
example
right
here
Where
actually
you
can
tell
me
actually
you
can
tell
me
these
are
some
of
the
peaks
or
from
here
from
this
point
on
something
is
going
down
What
are
what
do
you
think
are
the
reasons
or
what
may
be
the
reasons
Because
when
ever
you
start
looking
for
patterns
in
your
data
you
start
with
some
sort
of
a
hypothesis
some
sort
of
analysis
In
this
case
look
at
this
curves
and
see
something
must
be
gone
Or
maybe
either
right
here
or
maybe
right
here
or
maybe
right
here
Or
I
don't
know
Maybe
it
this
point
this
point
right
here
So
I
tried
to
explain
any
search
terms
for
communism
and
socialism
spike
during
approximately
beginning
of
the
Cold
War
after
World
War
II
They
drove
around
the
time
when
they
used
to
serve
holds
Good
Actually
It's
a
great
analysis
Very
good
just
by
looking
at
it
Right
here
Nineties
for
right
they're
not
quite
sure
when
it
works
It
uses
her
and
the
Soviet
camp
right
here
It's
fallen
in
Eastern
Europe
But
that's
exactly
the
time
socialism
The
term
is
going
down
And
capitalism
is
rapidly
going
up
compared
to
socialism
at
least
well
it
continues
but
compared
to
socialism
is
going
my
child
Communism
right
What
about
the
Communist
And
in
this
era
this
is
around
the
time
when
Stalin
died
for
shock
came
to
power
And
slowly
communism
is
going
to
the
term
of
communism
is
going
down
right
The
time
of
World
War
One
Right
here
right
there
somewhere
Don't
quit
your
dog
Quincy
Now
this
this
is
the
time
This
is
the
time
of
World
War
II
And
after
that
point
socialism
was
tried
in
going
up
Socialism
is
going
up
So
in
this
case
this
is
just
one
simple
quick
analysis
Whatever
we
knew
before
we
apply
Of
course
if
we
if
we
didn't
know
anything
about
it
we
probably
wouldn't
be
able
to
complete
the
analysis
but
why
did
they
bring
this
into
the
picture
Not
because
I
wanted
to
show
you
one
nice
simple
thing
to
wealth
It
required
lots
of
work
but
Google
of
course
but
it's
relatively
easy
to
implement
once
this
Kanban
books
What
I
wanted
to
point
out
when
you
are
dealing
with
data
when
you're
dealing
with
a
particular
data
set
If
you're
picking
a
project
for
class
you
need
to
understand
what
you're
talking
about
You
need
to
understand
very
well
for
the
era
that
you're
analyzing
If
you
are
working
and
you
happen
to
have
a
project
to
something
that
you
don't
have
a
clue
about
but
you
do
need
to
analyze
It
Gets
a
lot
of
times
as
computer
scientists
as
data
scientists
we
have
to
do
things
that
are
absolutely
unrelated
to
what
we
feel
comfortable
working
with
I
don't
know
how
well
you
know
political
science
biology
chemistry
would
if
you
need
to
analyze
that
data
The
first
and
the
main
point
that
I
want
to
make
here
tried
to
get
into
that
concept
Don't
do
it
blindly
Read
at
least
a
little
bit
at
least
enough
to
understand
what
your
attributes
mean
what
is
reasonable
what
is
not
reasonable
gets
some
basic
idea
Okay
Do
not
just
take
the
random
data
sets
and
try
to
analyze
it
It's
not
going
to
lead
to
anything
useful
