about
Quiz
three
this
problem
And
I
told
you
that
I
will
look
through
quizzes
in
see
how
you
did
on
it
And
then
I'll
decide
how
much
to
go
into
this
course
And
then
I
noticed
this
submission
should
reveal
the
author's
name
No
Okay
Exactly
When
we
IV
they
wanted
so
I
am
asking
okay
It
was
pretty
well
done
actually
is
an
excellent
Right
So
I
decided
I
will
be
lazy
and
I
will
use
the
solution
because
it
was
just
excellent
It
was
excellent
response
Thank
you
Okay
Thank
you
Emily
It
was
very
good
So
we
have
a
number
of
people
surveyed
They
were
asked
about
their
age
whether
they
can
swim
or
not
We're
trying
to
test
right
here
or
whether
there
is
any
connection
between
the
age
and
weather
person
can
swim
So
our
hypothesis
null
hypothesis
that
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
age
and
the
ability
to
swing
our
null
hypothesis
the
reason
no
relation
Let's
see
If
we
can
disprove
Alright
the
data's
right
here
40
to
forty
eight
twenty
eight
twenty
seven
This
is
our
data
What
do
we
need
to
the
first
Emily's
since
it
is
yours
maybe
you
can
help
us
So
what
I
did
was
I
first
calculate
the
marginal
frequencies
So
that's
given
under
the
totals
And
then
I
calculate
the
expected
value
for
each
each
column
And
then
I
did
that
by
using
the
formula
for
expected
which
I
showed
So
it's
just
basically
taking
the
sum
of
the
i'th
column
multiplying
by
the
kth
column
and
dividing
by
n
And
I
specified
FMEA
i'th
column
would
be
the
ability
to
swim
and
then
jth
row
would
be
the
age
So
an
example
would
be
I
would
take
145
which
is
the
total
people
who
can
swim
And
I
would
multiply
that
by
62
which
is
the
total
bar
People
die
less
than
20
years
old
And
then
take
that
and
divide
it
by
the
total
which
is
259
And
that's
how
I
got
34
71
And
then
you
can
repeat
that
for
are
the
columns
and
rows
And
that's
how
you
get
those
expected
values
which
are
in
parentheses
on
the
table
So
we
found
the
expected
values
Next
step
is
The
stated
that
hypothesis
And
if
we
want
we
can
stay
to
alternative
hypothesis
right
away
But
this
is
certainly
something
that
we're
thinking
about
That
our
null
hypothesis
is
there
is
no
relationship
and
then
our
alternative
hypothesis
is
there
is
a
relationship
So
you
can
state
it
right
away
right
here
when
you
start
or
well
in
this
case
we
stated
it
a
little
later
Okay
Alright
now
next
step
Next
step
we
calculate
the
chi-square
which
was
given
and
the
formula
on
the
slides
So
inclusively
you're
taking
each
observed
value
so
the
original
data
but
you
had
and
you're
subtracting
by
the
expected
value
which
we
found
which
is
given
in
parentheses
and
the
table
And
you're
dividing
that
by
the
expected
and
summing
up
So
an
example
would
be
you
take
42
which
is
the
number
of
people
that
can
swim
and
less
than
20
years
old
And
you
subtract
that
by
the
expected
which
is
34
71
and
then
take
the
square
of
that
difference
and
divide
it
by
34
71
and
do
the
same
for
every
You
little
section
in
the
world
for
everything
added
up
And
you
would
get
about
7
44
So
in
order
to
figure
out
whether
or
not
you
would
reject
or
not
reject
the
null
you
would
have
to
use
the
chi-square
table
given
in
the
slides
So
your
chi-squares
statistic
is
7
44
And
you
want
to
find
which
value
will
you
reject
the
reject
or
fail
to
reject
the
null
And
so
if
you
look
at
a
table
that
is
under
specified
I
guess
like
alpha
level
So
I
just
use
0
05
and
if
you
look
at
table
when
alpha
is
0
05
and
degrees
of
freedom
which
I
just
just
just
take
enabling
This
is
something
that
you
decide
for
yourself
Okay
I
wasn't
sure
so
I
just
did
that
but
then
I
also
explained
it
and
my
conclusion
by
yeah
anything
above
that
you
would
have
had
the
same
conclusion
regardless
Okay
so
degrees
of
freedom
can
be
found
by
taking
the
number
of
total
number
number
of
rows
you
have
minus
one
times
the
total
number
of
columns
minus
one
In
this
case
there'll
be
three
So
if
you
look
in
your
table
with
degrees
of
freedom
it
goes
three
You'll
see
a
bunch
of
different
values
for
different
levels
of
our
giving
us
tick
And
I
will
open
that
table
Okay
So
if
you
look
you
can
just
folks
into
degree
of
freedom
is
D
You
can
just
focus
on
the
row
in
which
degrees
of
freedom
because
three
And
then
you
want
to
see
where
your
test
statistic
falls
in
terms
of
all
those
different
values
So
you
can
see
that
7
44
is
less
than
7
815
which
is
alpha
equals
0
05
So
what
that
really
means
is
in
order
to
fail
to
reject
your
null
you
want
your
test
statistic
which
is
7
44
to
be
greater
than
a
certain
chi-squared
value
you
can
find
in
this
row
So
for
example
I
set
it
equal
0
05
And
since
7
44
is
not
greater
than
7
815
you
fail
to
reject
the
null
And
since
I
concluded
that
I
will
fail
to
reject
it
this
means
that
I
can
conclude
at
a
significance
level
of
0
05
that
age
and
ability
are
independent
and
therefore
you
can't
use
age
to
determine
a
person's
ability
to
swim
Thank
you
Emily
This
was
a
great
explanation
Is
great
Officially
Emily's
going
to
be
our
specialist
on
chi-square
analysis
if
you
have
any
questions
Alright
thank
you
very
much
It
was
really
good
That
explanation
that
solution
of
a
question
for
the
alpha
value
isn't
it
supposed
to
be
0
1
because
it
doesn't
and
the
p-value
is
greater
than
7
8
So
we
should
assume
the
0
1
instead
of
the
0
05
we
should
not
assume
we
should
set
this
value
for
ourselves
If
you're
comfortable
with
this
value
of
0
01
you
can
in
which
case
you
made
just
a
second
You
want
the
table
again
back
right
Right
here
right
So
you're
talking
about
this
value
right
Right
So
you
can
it's
not
a
common
value
to
take
For
our
significance
value
The
common
values
would
be
0
050
01
0
0
0
one
This
this
and
this
the
common
values
But
if
you
said
that
you
are
comfortable
with
this
value
then
you
will
look
at
6
251
and
you
will
say
Okay
Our
a
value
is
which
was
7
44
is
greater
than
this
one
then
we
can
read
we
can
reject
our
null
hypothesis
But
in
this
case
the
significance
value
is
10%
So
there
is
a
10%
probability
that
byte
rejecting
our
hypothesis
we're
making
an
error
But
actually
said
was
there
is
a
5%
significance
level
5%
which
is
the
most
common
value
But
each
researcher
decides
for
him
for
herself
what
to
take
in
in
a
particular
situation
So
if
you
did
that
type
of
analysis
that's
correct
as
well
Because
those
incorrect
because
doesn't
in
order
to
take
0
05
doesn't
your
p
value
have
to
be
greater
than
7
8
5
You're
answering
this
question
from
a
different
point
You're
saying
you're
asking
What
is
my
P-value
and
you're
saying
might
be
valued
between
this
and
that
right
So
you're
trying
to
find
the
probability
with
which
you
can
Instead
what
Emily
did
was
shifted
If
I
take
my
significance
level
at
5%
then
I
I
fail
to
reject
You
can
do
it
both
ways
Remember
this
lab
is
open
lab
and
you
can
show
everything
you
know
So
it
is
a
different
point
what
you
are
doing
you're
saying
alright
if
I
take
my
significance
level
at
this
I
can
accept
it
or
I
fail
to
reject
I
can
reject
it
And
instead
MO
says
I
fail
to
reject
it
because
she
took
5%
So
he
doesn't
need
The
higher
you
take
the
significance
level
the
higher
is
the
probability
that
you
allow
for
yourself
to
be
wrong
Here
So
it
doesn't
need
to
be
like
it
doesn't
need
to
be
greater
than
the
7
8
So
it
depends
on
the
significance
level
It
depends
if
somebody
gives
you
the
significance
level
then
you
can
you
can
just
look
35
And
if
you
value
is
greater
then
you
can
reject
your
null
hypothesis
If
your
value
is
less
you
cannot
Well
we're
saying
we
failed
to
reject
the
null
hypothesis
If
someone
gives
you
this
value
if
you
want
to
calculate
p
value
it's
just
a
little
bit
more
difficult
to
calculate
the
value
itself
Either
you
need
to
use
the
calculator
to
calculate
it
I
didn't
want
you
to
go
through
this
So
for
that
reason
are
just
gave
you
the
table
and
understand
Because
if
you
search
he
rejected
or
she
didn't
reject
the
null
hypothesis
She
didn't
reject
the
no
customers
report
right
She
did
not
reject
the
null
hypothesis
because
the
value
is
less
than
7
Right
Now
if
you're
saying
I'm
comfortable
with
0
01
You
can't
reject
because
the
value
in
this
case
the
big
weight
Ok
Usually
we
do
take
this
value
this
value
this
value
one
of
this
three
these
are
the
most
common
depending
on
the
problem
but
who
knows
what
kind
of
problem
we
are
going
to
look
at
in
the
future
So
this
table
tells
us
for
different
cases
what
we
can
and
cannot
do
Right
here
Of
course
what
we
wanted
to
do
is
to
understand
how
it
works
So
no
matter
what
significance
level
you
took
it's
okay
Alright
Okay
So
thinking
about
a
time
that
was
a
great
response
And
let's
move
on
Mathematical
models
Can
you
show
Emily's
table
again
for
the
quiz
Let
me
do
it
later
ok
because
I
closed
it
already
I
can
show
that
table
at
the
interclass
Sarah
interests
closer
So
we
is
it
big
enough
That's
fine
right
Practically
can
not
see
it
But
I
need
to
have
all
the
other
things
that
might
be
useful
for
you're
able
to
see
it
as
well
I
can
guess
Afterall
I
put
this
slide
together
myself
so
I
still
remember
what's
on
it
It's
a
pop
quiz
for
you
Okay
Last
time
we
started
talking
about
the
confusion
matrix
and
what
it
means
when
you
are
going
to
use
it
And
the
reason
for
it
to
be
called
confusion
accelerates
knotted
was
just
a
joke
So
I
told
you
that
sometimes
what's
here
looks
a
little
bit
confused
Why
First
of
all
we
have
some
knows
that
double
We
have
some
uses
that
double
What's
the
actual
node
and
what
is
this
predicted
note
Why
do
we
have
two
interests
for
the
actual
note
And
the
same
for
prediction
Fro
predicted
no
and
yes
This
confusion
matrix
allows
us
to
analyze
the
performance
of
a
model
which
is
very
important
It
is
to
say
I
am
going
to
use
this
something
We
will
talk
about
it
later
for
my
model
And
let's
see
if
I
can
train
them
to
train
my
model
to
make
some
predictions
Later
on
Training
the
model
find
in
some
coefficients
finding
some
weights
That
will
tell
me
if
I
get
the
data
that
I
do
not
know
the
answers
to
for
example
to
the
classification
question
two
then
I
can
say
OK
that
point
belongs
to
this
category
or
this
class
This
point
belongs
to
that
class
And
then
I
can
compute
how
many
of
those
I
predicted
correctly
and
how
many
I
predicted
incorrectly
If
this
is
my
data
that
I
trained
the
model
on
the
data
that
I
have
the
answers
to
this
questions
too
If
I
have
actual
information
about
them
Because
if
I
have
the
data
that
I've
never
seen
before
then
my
prediction
is
all
I'm
going
to
help
I
obviously
I'm
not
going
to
have
these
questions
answered
whether
I'm
right
or
wrong
So
that's
why
it
is
important
to
know
on
my
prediction
What
is
the
percent
that
I
will
be
answering
wrong
Correct
What
is
going
to
be
the
true
positive
to
negative
and
so
on
and
so
forth
And
what
is
the
value
of
o
It
seems
like
if
I
look
at
the
accuracy
that's
all
I
may
want
Accuracy
shows
how
many
times
my
prediction
is
correct
So
I
had
two
positives
two
true
negatives
And
I
divide
by
the
total
number
of
response
or
the
total
number
of
cases
In
this
case
0
91
is
my
accuracy
So
in
91%
of
cases
I
am
write
my
model
is
correct
Of
course
I
can
change
the
efficient
cell
weights
perimeters
in
I
can
get
a
little
bit
better
accuracy
a
little
bit
of
an
accuracy
but
I'm
quite
happy
with
measuring
accuracy
by
itself
Let's
see
What
does
it
mean
that
I
am
measuring
accuracy
That
means
I
am
saying
when
I
M
right
so
I
concentrate
on
this
values
to
be
as
large
as
possible
That's
great
That's
good
So
the
sum
of
these
values
right
here
divided
by
total
Now
what
what
happens
if
I
am
a
little
bit
wrong
If
I
give
some
false
positives
or
false
negatives
what's
going
to
happen
And
why
should
they
care
about
it
if
my
accuracy
is
good
enough
looks
like
what
do
you
think
Maybe
we're
very
good
at
predicting
when
something
will
be
true
but
maybe
we're
not
so
good
at
protecting
predicting
when
we're
going
to
be
or
in
predicting
No
And
then
we
have
OK
but
still
I'm
good
I'm
in
length
at
least
90%
of
cases
I'm
good
That's
quite
a
bit
right
Or
maybe
95
I
don't
know
I
think
the
idea
is
just
trust
any
results
Just
like
one
result
you
shouldn't
just
trust
a
100%
You
should
keep
in
mind
that
your
model
is
great
Thank
you
so
much
and
that's
true
But
this
is
what
air
can
receive
tells
me
The
higher
this
value
for
the
better
Or
I
should
pay
attention
to
something
else
Why
do
we
look
at
precision
and
recall
Last
time
we
talked
about
it
remember
about
the
precision
and
recall
as
well
What
are
the
cases
when
my
mistakes
can
cost
me
a
lot
When
i
wouldn't
even
care
about
accuracy
But
when
just
a
small
mistake
will
cost
me
a
lot
I'm
going
to
show
you
this
table
Would
the
accuracy
even
better
But
I
want
you
to
concentrate
on
for
example
this
number
So
it's
a
false
negative
right
It's
the
false-negative
it's
one
So
the
accuracy
here
is
very
very
high
And
yet
I
may
be
very
unhappy
about
this
one
being
missed
Why
would
you
think
it
may
be
very
critical
Give
me
a
case
when
it
is
critical
for
a
patient
and
a
covert
free
retirement
home
or
something
like
that
And
if
it
easily
if
it's
a
false-negative
very
easily
affect
everyone
else
inside
Ok
so
in
this
case
false-negative
result
was
given
to
a
person
who
is
sick
and
that
person
is
going
around
into
contaminate
and
everything
around
right
Yeah
Some
other
cases
Some
other
cases
When
it
is
important
So
when
you
see
a
data
set
you
understand
this
is
what
is
important
this
is
what
I
concentrate
on
So
another
example
could
be
like
an
earthquake
So
I
can
say
a
seismograph
predicts
no
earthquake
coming
9
9%
of
the
time
But
then
the
onetime
it
is
false
negative
then
everyone
is
very
scared
Ok
So
these
are
the
cases
different
types
of
fraud
cases
terrorists
These
are
the
cases
when
you
don't
really
care
how
many
good
predictions
you
make
You
care
about
this
false
negatives
when
you
would
prefer
to
make
more
mistakes
in
other
category
but
not
right
here
And
when
would
you
prefer
not
to
make
a
mistake
right
Oh
very
good
When
would
you
prefer
not
to
make
a
mistake
right
here
Not
to
give
a
false
positive
and
false
positive
A
classic
example
that
is
usually
given
is
a
Spam
Spam
prediction
Think
about
it
So
how
can
you
explain
that
false
positive
in
this
case
is
really
not
what
you
want
to
see
when
you
wanted
to
rather
than
this
being
identified
as
negative
Even
if
the
classifier
fire
is
mistaken
Why
explained
In
spam
detection
Just
talk
You
don't
have
to
put
it
into
That
identifies
like
an
internship
offer
us
Pfam
and
puts
them
in
that
folder
and
you
miss
it
Okay
now
everybody's
going
to
remember
this
example
That's
a
very
good
one
So
if
it
identifies
an
email
as
a
spam
and
destroys
it
or
better
if
it
puts
it
into
the
spam
box
then
you're
going
to
miss
it
You
would
much
rather
go
through
ten
emails
that
are
spam
and
were
not
identified
as
such
then
you
would
lose
this
very
important
one
that
were
identified
as
spam
and
thrown
out
Okay
So
in
this
case
a
good
measure
is
precision
In
the
first
case
a
good
measure
is
a
recall
In
this
case
because
this
is
what
I
concentrate
on
And
in
this
case
I
concentrated
on
this
So
I
want
to
reduce
this
possible
correct
So
I
concentrate
on
precision
Usually
it's
a
fight
between
the
two
by
reducing
one-year
increasingly
So
you
need
to
identify
what's
more
important
for
you
in
a
particular
case
and
then
you
can
work
on
that
particular
measure
Okay
So
we
talked
about
this
last
time
We
already
talked
about
bias
and
variance
One
thing
that
I
want
to
remind
you
it's
very
important
to
think
about
bias
When
you
thinking
about
Presenting
a
model
When
you
are
saying
I
am
going
to
have
a
straight
line
or
a
linear
function
as
my
predictor
And
you
look
at
your
data
you
have
no
clue
what
it
fits
What
kind
of
model
needs
to
be
used
in
this
case
But
triggered
when
not
linear
You
are
going
to
have
an
incredibly
high
bias
That
means
you
are
trying
to
use
something
that
cannot
explain
your
data
that
doesn't
fit
your
data
Don't
try
You
cannot
train
your
model
to
make
it
a
good
predictor
When
we're
talking
about
First
we
come
up
with
some
model
and
then
we
train
it
to
predict
the
outcome
better
We're
talking
about
a
model
that
fits
your
data
If
you
daddy
can
not
be
predicted
by
a
straight
line
then
don't
even
try
it
It's
not
going
to
work
Now
if
your
data
is
somehow
can't
be
predicted
with
a
straight
line
maybe
as
it
is
right
here
then
what
you're
doing
you're
saying
I
will
try
to
fit
it
to
fit
the
data
You're
trying
one
line
another
line
another
line
another
line
and
so
on
And
you
see
which
one
is
going
to
minimize
the
loss
which
one
is
going
to
minimize
the
error
Now
to
minimize
the
error
we
need
to
understand
how
to
measure
for
the
air
first
let's
see
how
we
are
going
to
measure
the
vector
The
first
one
What
we
talked
about
some
of
this
and
we
will
talk
more
about
it
Let's
talk
about
loss
functions
They
are
going
to
tell
us
what
is
our
loss
what
is
our
ear
what
it
is
that
we
want
to
minimize
This
is
a
famous
data
set
for
chemical
that
you've
seen
before
It
shows
the
tips
The
data
set
itself
shows
the
tips
that
were
given
to
a
particular
waiter
when
this
was
the
amount
that
the
customers
paid
Here
some
extra
information
So
this
is
the
percent
i
mean
this
is
the
tip
itself
which
is
shown
right
here
as
a
percent
Right
here
It's
common
to
give
about
15%
of
the
amount
of
your
bill
Let's
see
that
particular
way
too
wanted
to
see
if
this
is
indeed
true
If
he
could
well
suppose
that
it
wasn't
real
story
dinner
If
he
could
predict
from
the
amount
that
people
will
pay
the
amount
of
tip
that
he's
going
to
get
And
also
from
some
other
features
Now
is
that
a
month
is
a
good
predictor
Actually
what
is
the
percent
of
a
tip
He's
got
to
get
So
this
is
the
percent
up
to
and
this
is
just
the
proportion
of
the
customers
that
gave
this
particular
tool
is
you
can
see
it's
indeed
somewhere
in
the
era
of
May
15%
be
these
are
a
little
bit
less
but
then
20%
is
high
enough
So
we're
not
quite
clear
where
this
value
is
Somewhere
here
maybe
right
between
I
don't
know
12
I
guess
12
and
somewhere
around
20
So
we're
going
to
try
to
analyze
this
That's
the
situation
we're
going
to
try
to
analyze
First
let's
look
at
the
following
loss
function
that
will
determine
the
error
or
loss
We
call
it
Suppose
theta
is
our
estimate
A
new
customer
or
a
family
They
spent
so
much
money
And
I
predict
that
the
tip
that
they're
going
to
give
this
is
my
theta
That's
my
prediction
Might
estimate
points
Why
I
Y1
Y2
is
the
data
So
I
do
know
that
output
right
here
This
is
something
that
I
know
What
I
wanted
to
see
is
the
distance
between
what
I
know
and
what
I
predict
between
a
what
is
the
mistake
Mistake
but
I'm
going
to
make
every
time
because
my
prediction
the
function
that
we're
going
to
use
or
at
least
level
start
with
this
one
is
the
mean
squared
error
mean
squared
error
Let's
see
how
we
calculate
Don't
concentrate
on
this
year
Suppose
we
only
have
one
data
point
which
is
14
We
have
a
customer
that
gave
14%
Because
suppose
our
prediction
is
11%
Let's
calculate
the
loss
The
loss
is
calculated
as
the
difference
between
this
14
and
our
prediction
which
is
11
squared
times
one
over
n
In
this
case
we
only
have
one
data
point
so
it's
going
to
be
just
14
minus
11
squared
which
is
nine
So
our
loss
in
this
case
is
nine
We
will
say
alright
well
let's
assume
it
is
12
What's
the
loss
in
this
case
14
minus
12
is
Two
squared
is
going
to
give
us
four
Remember
we
only
have
1
right
here
so
that
is
going
to
be
one
Alright
It's
four
right
here
If
we
have
theta
13
it's
one
liter
14
That's
exactly
what
we
predicted
And
it's
equal
to
the
data
so
the
loss
is
0
and
so
on
The
minimal
loss
right
here
And
if
I
predicted
14
then
it
would
be
the
best
result
So
this
is
how
we
calculate
loss
in
how
we're
looking
at
the
minimal
loss
If
we
only
have
one
data
point
suppose
we
have
five
As
in
this
case
we
do
the
same
for
each
as
we
did
for
the
one
on
the
previous
slide
we
calculate
the
distance
between
each
of
our
data
entries
and
our
prediction
So
11
minus
12
squared
is
going
to
be
one
Right
here
is
going
to
be
one
then
12
minus
12
squared
then
15
minus
15
squared
I'm
being
sloppy
about
the
order
because
I
square
it
Anyhow
that's
the
reason
we
don't
want
this
signs
That's
why
we
never
take
it
linear
Because
we
don't
want
to
for
the
data
positive
and
negative
If
we
make
a
lot
of
mistakes
they
will
eat
up
themselves
if
they're
both
positive
and
negative
bright
So
we
don't
want
to
say
that
We
always
use
the
absolute
value
or
square
So
the
sign
doesn't
matter
right
here
We
just
calculate
the
distance
between
one
and
the
other
Will
get
this
case
square
root
Is
that
clear
That's
an
easy
formula
right
So
we
calculate
the
loss
for
each
theta
We
don't
know
what
theta
is
We're
seeing
What
if
it
is
12
whatever
it
is
13
what
about
14
And
so
on
and
so
forth
Later
on
when
I
see
all
this
values
I
will
say
OK
it
looks
like
this
is
the
best
one
So
I
can
go
with
15
Now
Not
really
But
close
In
a
couple
of
minutes
I
will
show
you
why
not
really
but
we
can
do
that
Alright
We
look
at
our
original
data
set
The
previous
one
was
just
an
example
Then
this
is
the
picture
that
we
are
going
to
get
If
we
predict
theta
being
14
5
then
that's
going
to
get
our
loss
Here
They
are
they
are
just
using
this
same
formula
So
it
looks
like
seems
like
something's
happening
right
here
Need
to
analyze
more
We
don't
know
exactly
where
it's
at
It's
not
exactly
15
or
15
5
or
here
I
don't
know
where
it
exactly
Right
But
I
can
see
That
is
probably
in
this
area
If
I
know
that
my
function
has
one
minimum
one
minimum
Now
this
is
a
square
function
So
it's
going
to
be
a
parabola
X
square
function
is
a
parabola
Well
it
could
be
parabola
with
branches
down
But
in
our
case
so
we're
going
to
have
one
minimum
The
question
is
just
to
find
that
minimum
These
are
our
values
values
for
theta
and
loss
So
this
is
the
curve
that
we're
looking
for
This
the
curve
What
we
need
is
the
minimum
How
to
find
that
minimum
will
tell
us
someone
who
remembers
calculus
Hoops
Are
you
there
We'll
find
the
minimum
when
d
L
d
theta
is
0
What
is
d
L
d
theta
Ok
so
you
do
remember
that's
right
So
you
find
the
derivative
or
the
gradient
And
you
find
the
derivative
And
you
will
find
yes
when
this
derivative
is
equal
to
0
this
will
be
a
point
of
your
extreme
weather
It
is
the
minimum
or
the
maximum
You
can
check
by
looking
at
the
value
of
any
point
here
and
point
Correct
So
your
function
if
your
function
changes
the
behavior
from
decreasing
to
increasing
or
the
derivative
is
negative
to
positive
Then
you're
dealing
with
the
minimal
and
vice
versa
You
are
dealing
with
the
maximum
This
is
just
a
quick
review
I
will
not
ask
you
to
do
that
class
I'm
trying
to
avoid
using
calculus
because
I
don't
know
how
many
of
you
have
this
classes
Hopefully
it
did
but
I
don't
know
but
that's
the
idea
I
do
advise
you
to
review
this
just
to
understand
what
exactly
we
are
doing
And
why
would
I
want
you
to
think
right
now
about
is
both
a
slide
that
I
want
I
want
something
else
We
will
go
later
through
more
examples
But
what
I
wanted
to
think
right
now
if
your
function
only
has
one
minimum
that
you're
going
to
reach
it
If
your
function
has
several
and
then
you
have
minimum
maximum
and
so
on
You
gotta
be
very
careful
here
We're
going
to
talk
more
about
it
next
time
I
hope
What
we
did
today
you
understood
it
was
quite
easy
hopefully
but
I
don't
want
to
run
What
I
would
like
you
to
do
this
time
on
your
own
later
on
I'm
not
going
to
go
over
it
in
class
I
want
you
to
look
at
the
following
function
mean
absolute
error
The
idea
is
absolutely
the
same
It's
on
slides
We're
not
going
to
use
mean
absolute
error
Well
or
if
you
want
for
some
tests
if
you
make
a
decision
to
use
it
that's
fine
too
But
we
will
talk
why
sometimes
we
prefer
mean
absolute
error
Just
look
at
it
Again
the
idea
is
the
same
but
instead
of
taken
a
square
in
this
case
you're
taken
just
the
absolute
value
so
that
the
rest
is
the
same
