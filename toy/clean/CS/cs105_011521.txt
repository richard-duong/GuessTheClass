To
record
probability
for
data
science
It
certainly
is
not
going
to
be
a
course
on
probability
I'm
not
going
to
compete
with
CS
155
even
this
is
a
course
in
statistics
that
covers
probability
as
well
We
are
going
we're
only
going
to
have
one
class
on
It
may
be
a
little
bit
more
up
to
two
at
most
So
I'm
going
to
give
you
just
some
And
that
will
be
enough
for
our
purposes
We're
going
to
start
with
independent
events
In
probability
two
events
are
independent
if
the
occurrence
of
one
event
doesn't
effect
the
outcome
of
the
other
So
their
probabilities
are
independent
The
doc
can
jump
as
many
times
as
he
wants
and
the
coin
is
going
to
be
flipped
right
here
When
may
have
heads
or
tails
but
it
doesn't
depend
on
UDL
and
vice
versa
And
the
order
doesn't
matter
either
Well
unless
he
decides
to
eat
it
P
of
a
and
B
the
probability
of
a
and
B
if
the
events
are
independent
Only
if
the
events
are
independent
If
the
probability
of
a
times
the
probability
of
B
only
if
the
events
are
independent
Dependent
events
Two
events
are
dependent
when
the
outcome
of
the
first
influences
the
outcome
of
the
second
or
the
outcome
of
one
influences
the
outcome
of
the
other
one
The
probability
of
a
and
B
the
advance
or
dependent
is
the
probability
of
a
If
we're
talking
about
a
happen
first
event
a
happens
first
times
the
probability
B
of
a
In
this
case
is
just
times
the
probability
of
B
because
the
event
B
doesn't
depend
on
event
So
it's
probability
doesn't
depend
on
the
probability
of
if
they
are
dependent
then
it's
the
probability
of
a
And
then
may
cause
some
different
outcome
in
B
So
we
must
account
for
it
times
the
probability
of
B
given
that
a
already
occurred
and
we
know
the
outcome
of
a
Next
mutually
exclusive
Inclusive
events
Exclusive
mutually
exclusive
events
are
events
that
cannot
happen
at
the
same
time
They
cannot
they
don't
happen
at
the
same
time
In
this
case
the
probability
of
a
or
B
is
equal
to
the
probability
of
a
plus
the
probability
of
v
And
this
is
the
time
what
I
would
like
to
ask
you
Can
you
please
give
me
some
examples
of
mutually
exclusive
events
Mutually
exclusive
events
Join
a
black
sock
or
white
sock
from
a
drone
Daytime
or
nighttime
Well
daytime
or
nighttime
But
this
is
not
an
event
Somehow
maybe
rephrase
It
Bought
the
sachs
Well
it's
not
so
clear
I
mean
the
condition
itself
flipping
a
coin
and
getting
heads
or
tails
will
it's
not
a
mutually
exclusive
event
Or
maybe
I
just
misunderstood
what
you
were
saying
Okay
we
will
look
at
some
examples
later
on
A
bit
point
I
would
like
you
to
point
out
these
events
are
mutually
exclusive
and
these
events
are
not
These
events
are
inclusive
Alright
The
outcome
of
the
coin
you
know
they
both
yep
Okay
Inclusive
events
or
events
that
can
happen
at
the
same
time
If
you
remember
111
we
worked
a
lot
on
this
right
If
they
advanced
can't
happen
at
the
same
time
then
the
probability
of
a
or
B
is
equal
to
the
probability
of
a
plus
the
probability
of
B
minus
the
intersection
Remember
inclusion-exclusion
principle
If
we
take
the
cardinality
of
this
the
cardinality
of
that
then
the
intersection
can
become
will
be
counted
twice
And
in
order
to
know
the
cardinality
of
the
union
we
need
to
subtract
this
intersection
the
cardinality
of
this
intersection
in
which
case
we're
going
to
get
the
correct
number
So
these
events
are
not
mutually
exclusive
they
aren't
inclusive
And
you
cannot
compute
the
cardinality
by
just
adding
the
cardinality
of
each
He
can
not
compute
the
probability
of
The
event
a
or
event
B
By
Ed
in
the
probability
of
a
and
probability
of
B
you
have
to
subtract
the
intersection
We
will
look
at
all
of
these
examples
later
Interest
a
couple
of
minutes
All
right
Here
is
an
example
Five
age
bill
subscribers
were
asked
what
they
would
prefer
watching
the
Game
of
Thrones
World
or
something
else
Were
the
word
right
here
213
male
subscribers
they
answered
the
Game
of
Thrones
18
would
prefer
westward
world
one
hundred
and
five
hundred
and
footage
female
We
want
to
analyze
this
data
Anyway
we
want
right
now
So
first
question
First
question
Can
we
somehow
look
the
probability
of
being
of
a
particular
gender
and
choosing
a
particular
First
Let's
add
the
number
of
people
that
chose
Game
of
Thrones
The
second
show
and
all
the
other
shows
we
will
add
the
number
of
male
and
female
subscribers
That's
the
data
that
we
have
So
we
have
500
total
Now
it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
first
First
If
we
want
to
compute
you
probably
can't
see
them
If
we
wanted
to
answer
the
question
how
many
female
prefer
the
Game
of
Thrones
show
You
can
look
into
the
cell
and
you
will
see
a
121%
out
of
total
It
is
a
120
is
0
240
24
And
I
will
do
the
same
for
each
value
I'll
take
each
value
and
divide
by
500
It
will
give
me
that
person
as
opposed
to
give
him
though
that
number
What
this
value
represents
Each
value
tells
us
the
number
of
I
mean
the
probability
of
being
of
a
particular
gender
choosing
a
particular
show
or
in
this
case
authorship
And
these
numbers
these
numbers
tell
me
These
numbers
represent
the
probability
of
choosing
one
of
the
shows
Independently
on
the
Chandra
or
right
here
being
a
male
or
a
female
As
you
can
see
these
two
add
up
to
one
These
three
add
up
to
one
What
else
is
one
What
else
is
one
here
The
sum
of
the
proportions
of
females
and
males
right
Right
is
this
sum
Okay
So
what
it
is
that
we
found
each
right
here
Each
data
point
in
a
cell
tells
us
the
joint
probability
of
a
particular
gender
and
choosing
a
particular
show
or
other
In
this
case
this
is
a
joint
probability
That's
the
joint
probability
of
all
of
those
And
if
we'll
look
at
all
of
them
at
the
same
time
then
we'll
look
at
the
joint
probability
distribution
The
joint
probability
distribution
What
is
on
this
side
and
at
the
bottom
these
are
marginal
probability
There's
a
marginal
probability
We
are
not
looking
at
one
of
the
variables
will
just
analyze
in
another
one
Well
in
this
case
there
are
only
two
So
when
analyzing
this
variable
independently
on
the
gender
this
is
what
0
4
represents
how
many
people
chose
Game
of
Thrones
Now
again
this
is
the
marginal
probability
And
if
I
look
at
all
three
This
is
its
distribution
This
are
the
marginal
probabilities
as
well
Each
of
them
is
a
marginal
probability
And
if
I
look
at
the
two
that's
going
to
be
a
distribution
Distribution
Any
questions
Alright
Nokia
Yes
I
understand
I
will
ask
you
some
questions
And
if
you
remember
or
better
put
the
notes
for
yourself
and
answer
those
questions
clay
a
little
bit
with
probabilities
We're
not
going
to
touch
anything
difficult
to
date
I
don't
want
to
say
that
this
is
all
that
you
studied
in
your
high
school
Probably
not
But
I'm
trying
to
cover
it
at
a
really
low
simple
level
So
I
don't
want
you
to
be
overwhelmed
You
get
255
and
you
will
get
what
else
you
need
But
this
will
be
enough
for
now
for
now
For
this
class
Also
you
need
to
understand
it
really
well
Not
a
lot
but
you
have
to
understand
it
well
okay
Alright
Next
The
question
here
is
what
is
the
probability
of
an
age
bill
subscriber
being
male
or
preferring
Westworld
male
or
paternity
preferring
West
work
Alright
let's
take
0
46
That's
the
probability
of
being
a
male
And
let's
take
0
25
and
add
them
because
0
25
is
the
marginal
probability
of
choosing
Westworld
Add
them
together
This
will
get
the
answer
correct
You're
double
counting
the
0
2
for
Westworld
mail
Right
So
you
can't
just
add
both
0
25
46
You
have
to
add
them
individually
so
you
don't
double
count
the
point
to
you
can't
add
these
two
You
have
to
add
them
individually
If
you
just
add
the
0
460
25
wouldn't
you
be
counting
0
2
twice
Okay
Yeah
I
know
that
you
were
right
at
the
first
time
I
was
just
trying
to
make
you
explain
it
a
little
bit
better
So
what
you're
saying
is
if
we
add
0
06
and
0
25
That
means
we
counted
0
2
twice
because
it
is
a
part
of
being
male
and
it
is
a
part
of
choosing
westward
This
two
events
are
what
Inclusive
They
are
inclusive
exactly
Well
they're
not
mutually
exclusive
In
which
case
you
need
to
if
you
want
you
can
add
0
06
as
0
25
but
then
you
need
to
subtract
the
intersection
Right
Or
you
can
just
go
ahead
and
add
one-by-one
Now
question
Question
right
now
is
a
way
to
check
whether
two
events
are
mutually
exclusive
for
the
joint
distribution
joint
marginal
distribution
available
in
this
nice
form
So
what
is
another
way
to
check
its
coming
right
from
this
Alright
I'll
leave
it
as
a
question
Alright
next
what
is
the
probability
of
an
age
bill
subscriber
being
a
male
or
preferring
Westworld
being
male
And
prefer
westward
What
is
it
We
just
computed
it
We're
looking
at
the
formula
at
the
general
formula
So
this
won't
be
the
0
46
plus
0
25
minus
0
2
right
So
the
probability
of
a
or
B
is
equal
to
the
probability
of
a
plus
the
probability
of
B
minus
the
probability
of
their
intersection
Question
Can
we
use
this
formula
If
the
events
are
mutually
exclusive
Yes
because
the
intersection
would
be
0
if
there
were
mutually
exclusive
Yes
the
intersection
would
be
0
if
they
are
mutually
exclusive
So
this
is
the
answer
to
your
question
Okay
I'm
still
not
stating
it
explicitly
but
you
probably
understand
conditional
probability
Conditional
probability
is
the
probability
that
an
event
will
occur
based
on
the
condition
But
another
event
has
occurred
So
one
event
has
occurred
We'll
look
at
the
next
event
But
we
already
know
that
the
first
event
has
occurred
And
we
can
find
out
the
outcome
of
that
event
That's
the
condition
probability
Does
the
conditional
probability
don't
mix
the
joint
and
conditional
probabilities
in
the
joint
probability
The
events
are
independent
If
the
conditional
probability
they
are
dependent
The
probability
of
B
given
that
event
a
has
occurred
is
the
probability
of
a
and
B
divided
by
the
probability
of
gates
Of
course
we
wanted
to
make
sure
before
we
go
and
divide
by
the
probability
of
a
of
course
we
want
to
make
sure
that
the
probability
of
non-zero
is
not
0
The
same
example
We
have
at
joint
probability
right
here
And
we
have
a
marginal
probability
right
there
Question
Not
a
just
God
and
age
bill
subscription
What
is
the
chance
that
her
favorite
show
will
be
Game
of
Thrones
First
question
can
be
and
the
question
that
we
asked
before
what
is
a
probability
of
being
a
female
and
choosing
Game
of
Thrones
In
this
question
right
now
we
have
seen
we
know
she
is
female
Given
that
it
is
a
female
what's
the
probability
that
she
chooses
Game
of
Thrones
Do
you
feel
the
difference
between
the
two
In
the
first
what's
the
probability
of
this
and
that
That's
the
joint
probability
Here
conditional
Our
subscriber
is
a
female
I
know
that
What's
the
probability
that
she
chooses
gain
of
from's
So
our
event
has
occurred
We
wanted
to
see
how
it
influences
event
So
how
do
we
compute
it
It's
going
to
be
the
probability
of
a
and
b
So
this
is
our
joint
probability
but
it
has
to
be
divided
by
the
probability
of
B
Divided
by
the
probability
of
B
which
is
0
54
This
is
our
conditional
probability
Usually
I
see
problems
if
anything
in
probability
than
I
see
some
problems
students
have
with
conditional
probability
So
this
is
the
one
that
is
a
little
bit
harder
to
understand
me
Professor
Any
advice
on
how
we
should
pick
the
order
when
we're
looking
at
a
question
Like
what
depends
what
Well
it's
going
to
be
coming
from
the
question
from
from
the
situation
You
see
non
interest
God
and
age
bill
subscription
she's
over
d
What
is
the
chance
that
her
favorite
show
will
be
Game
of
Thrones
Now
you
already
know
this
is
female
right
So
if
you
know
that
the
subscriber
is
female
what
is
the
chance
that
a
particular
show
is
going
to
be
her
favorite
trope
Now
this
happened
first
Being
female
in
this
case
happened
first
And
this
is
a
great
question
This
is
where
you
all
remember
this
formula
It's
what
to
divide
by
what
By
or
rather
divide
by
what
what
do
we
divide
in
But
right
now
I
will
show
the
example
where
the
roles
or
the
situation
is
switched
And
he
will
see
the
difference
here
Let
me
click
me
see
this
one
I
can
go
back
to
this
Given
the
better
subscribers
favorite
show
is
Westworld
What
is
the
probability
that
their
male
Somebody
said
my
westward
My
favorite
show
is
Westworld
Who
am
I
All
right
what's
the
probability
So
in
this
case
what
we
know
is
that
the
person
chose
Westworld
Then
this
is
what
occurred
first
That
already
has
occurred
What
do
I
do
here
I
find
the
probability
of
a
and
b
which
is
just
our
joint
probability
That's
easy
And
divided
by
the
probability
of
B
and
divide
by
the
marginal
probability
And
here
we're
just
showing
the
conditional
probability
distribution
if
we
answer
this
question
three
times
So
what
is
the
probability
of
choosing
Game
of
Thrones
That
what's
the
probability
of
choosing
Westworld
while
being
female
What's
the
probability
of
choosing
some
other
show
That's
that
in
each
of
those
cases
where
he's
on
this
same
formula
but
we're
just
changing
the
joint
probability
The
joint
probability
changes
The
marginal
probability
stays
We
divide
by
this
marginal
probability
every
time
Okay
Alright
Now
again
another
question
which
relates
to
the
previous
question
or
not
necessarily
religious
but
somewhat
similar
to
a
previous
question
Can
we
answer
the
question
whether
the
two
events
are
independent
By
looking
at
some
of
this
data
on
conditional
probability
Do
we
know
if
the
events
are
independent
What
would
you
say
Just
by
thinking
The
events
are
independent
If
what
So
in
this
case
they
are
dependent
You
can
not
make
anything
out
of
here
But
if
they
weren't
dependent
what
would
happen
One
outcome
does
not
affect
the
other
outcome
right
One
outcome
does
not
affect
the
other
Being
female
doesn't
affect
Choosing
westward
That
means
if
I
compute
my
conditional
probability
of
choosing
Westworld
under
the
condition
of
being
male
or
female
It
must
be
equal
to
the
probability
of
choosing
Westworld
If
they
once
weren't
independent
these
two
numbers
would
be
the
same
Great
Ok
And
one
more
example
right
here
Alex
rolls
a
pair
of
dice
What
is
the
probability
that
both
numbers
are
odd
This
sum
is
six
Their
sum
is
six
so
it
is
given
but
their
sum
is
six
What's
the
probability
that
both
numbers
are
odd
In
this
case
what
are
you
given
What
is
the
first
event
What
is
the
condition
In
this
case
The
sum
is
six
right
So
you
know
that
this
sum
is
six
You
want
to
only
find
the
probability
of
both
numbers
being
odd
if
their
sum
is
six
You
don't
care
about
any
other
cases
were
numbers
are
odd
For
example
let's
say
35
You
didn't
care
about
this
case
because
there's
some
it's
not
six
How
can
this
question
be
answered
Let's
see
These
are
all
possible
outcomes
In
other
words
this
is
the
sample
space
The
cases
where
both
numbers
are
odd
Cases
where
the
sum
of
two
numbers
is
six
How
many
outcomes
we
have
where
the
were
two
numbers
are
odd
and
their
sum
is
6123
How
many
pairs
we
have
whose
sum
is
612345
So
after
this
gets
easy
one
divided
by
the
other
But
as
you
pointed
out
what's
the
most
difficult
is
is
to
understand
is
this
the
case
conditional
probability
Because
sometimes
for
not
necessarily
every
time
somebody's
going
to
tell
you
find
P
of
a
given
that
B
has
occurred
It
may
not
be
stated
clearly
even
in
this
question
probably
at
the
beginning
you
were
not
sure
whether
it
is
a
conditional
probability
Which
event
occurred
first
which
one
would
condition
on
right
We
already
talked
about
it
about
the
marginal
distribution
and
conditional
or
joint
distribution
and
conditional
distribution
I
included
several
slides
for
permanently
for
those
students
that
want
little
more
math
But
I'm
not
going
to
go
over
in
class
If
you
want
you
can
look
at
it
We
can
talk
about
it
later
But
it
is
I
don't
know
I
doubt
that
it's
going
to
be
started
in
155
but
certainly
in
red
horse
That
is
going
to
be
the
proper
language
So
it's
up
to
you
Here's
one
example
of
that
I
included
here
as
well
It
is
for
you
And
what
do
you
think
it's
going
to
be
That's
going
to
be
your
in-class
quiz
the
quiz
one
And
you
need
to
complete
it
in
about
eight
minutes
and
been
a
great
school
And
that's
going
to
be
your
first
great
for
quiz
one
A
reasonable
not
scope
Well
that's
a
question
You
take
it
now
Take
a
picture
and
submit
a
grade
school
There
is
an
option
Whichever
one
you
prefer
As
an
option
I
can
give
you
this
quiz
to
take
anytime
you
want
and
submit
by
Saturday
night
So
what
would
you
like
It
is
submit
in
eight
minutes
or
by
Saturday
night
whichever
you
prefer
Alden
I
think
I
was
fine
with
me
Saturday
night
One
condition
Well
23
sterile
conditions
First
It's
okay
if
you
talk
about
it
But
I
don't
want
you
to
copy
obviously
If
anyone
copies
I
apologize
That's
going
to
be
given
it
All
right
But
you
can
talk
about
it
if
you
want
to
If
you
want
you
can
compare
your
answers
but
not
I
got
255
What
did
you
get
So
make
it
somehow
not
so
clear
The
reason
for
it
If
your
answer
is
wrong
and
another
personable
strict
match
them
that
answer
That's
going
to
be
wrong
too
And
those
two
will
be
so
wrong
that
there
will
be
marked
for
for
treating
If
the
answers
are
very
raw
and
very
weird
I'm
not
saying
255
in
this
case
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
problem
But
sometimes
I
know
I
gave
you
this
example
before
If
you
multiply
15
by
two
and
you
get
some
INT01
I
can
understand
that
if
you
get
300
I
can
understand
that
because
yeah
You
did
addition
instead
or
you
multiply
them
then
you
wrote
an
extra
0
But
if
you
get
a
ten-point
five
and
there
will
be
two
students
that
will
get
18
5
That
is
trench
And
I
don't
want
any
problems
I
don't
want
any
kind
of
cheat
And
I'm
going
to
be
very
light
on
gradient
this
quiz
But
I
do
want
you
to
practice
This
is
the
main
purpose
of
quizzes
I
think
all
of
you
will
get
high
grades
for
quizzes
but
I
do
want
you
to
practice
with
this
material
ok
You
can
always
use
any
textbooks
but
please
do
not
Google
this
questions
Because
if
I
see
the
solution
that
matches
some
online
solution
I'm
going
to
give
set
As
I
said
before
that
the
purpose
of
this
quizzes
is
not
to
grade
you
on
the
final
final
answer
but
for
you
to
practice
Alright
Now
if
you
cheat
on
this
quiz
them
on
midterm
you
may
not
get
this
question
We
write
it
on
paper
and
secant
it
You
can
do
it
either
way
you
want
You
can
use
later
kick
in
right
on
paper
For
all
quizzes
it's
assumed
you're
in
class
and
you're
trying
to
do
with
fast
Now
I
must
be
able
to
read
it
Please
write
it
clearly
and
when
you
upload
to
great
scope
open
it
and
make
sure
that
I
can
read
it
or
who
I
was
going
to
grade
it
can
create
it
Anything
specific
you
are
looking
for
And
this
is
not
really
just
give
a
good
explanation
So
you
need
to
you
don't
need
to
write
anything
extra
you
explanation
but
give
a
sufficient
explanation
as
to
why
you
are
using
a
particular
formula
or
any
questions
about
anything
at
all
I
am
not
going
to
start
a
new
part
I
deliberately
finished
right
now
because
the
next
part
is
a
little
bit
more
complicated
But
by
the
time
we
moved
to
this
I
wanted
to
be
very
good
and
very
clear
on
the
joint
conditional
probability
on
all
these
marginal
probabilities
Or
else
I
will
talk
and
it
will
just
