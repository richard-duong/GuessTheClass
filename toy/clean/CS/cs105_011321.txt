Something
that
is
very
easy
I
told
you
as
far
as
the
visualization
a
lot
of
stuff
will
be
something
that
you
worked
with
before
in
what
I
would
like
or
what
I
wanted
to
do
is
to
combine
all
of
those
So
when
it
comes
to
some
presentation
to
the
time
and
you
need
to
perform
data
visualization
You
have
all
of
this
in
one
set
of
slides
and
he
will
go
through
it
You
will
decide
what
it
is
you
want
to
use
for
your
particular
case
So
that
is
more
like
a
guide
for
you
of
what
to
do
Of
course
bar
charts
is
something
that
you
know
that's
probably
one
of
the
easiest
forums
to
present
information
And
yet
sometimes
it's
better
than
any
other
more
complicated
form
For
example
this
one
is
showing
the
number
of
electrode
right
here
Let
me
increase
there
All
right
The
number
of
the
number
of
residents
part
electoral
vote
When
you're
looking
at
this
chart
you
can
understand
that
the
number
of
people
per
one
vote
is
very
uneven
and
very
different
In
some
states
you
need
to
have
about
200
thousand
people
per
one
vote
in
August
takes
700
Why
it
is
we
don't
have
time
right
now
to
deal
with
this
question
and
when
this
with
this
answer
But
if
you're
interested
go
and
look
up
In
other
another
visual
that
represents
the
results
of
the
elections
for
2012
If
you
remember
Barack
Obama
von
won
this
election
which
is
below
right
here
These
are
the
states
that
were
pro
democratic
in
this
election
Now
if
you
look
at
this
map
it
looks
like
there's
more
red
than
blue
But
if
you
look
at
the
numbers
the
numbers
represent
the
number
of
electoral
votes
that
went
towards
the
victory
And
there
are
over
300
electoral
votes
that
were
for
the
Democratic
candidate
and
for
the
republicans
over
200
But
when
you
look
at
this
map
there
is
some
sort
of
misrepresentation
because
the
area
covered
by
red
is
much
larger
What
the
authors
did
right
here
The
reduced
area
of
a
state
if
the
number
of
electoral
votes
that
the
state
gives
is
proportionally
lower
than
for
other
states
So
right
here
that
area
represents
or
rabbit
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
electoral
votes
Now
this
when
you
look
at
this
map
you
already
see
that
there
is
more
blue
than
red
in
this
case
So
this
is
how
you
can
use
a
map
but
with
a
little
change
Yeah
This
is
the
book
I
told
you
I'm
going
to
be
given
you
books
rather
than
give
you
one
textbook
I
will
give
you
suggestions
about
different
books
that
I
use
for
particular
topics
For
this
topic
I
used
mostly
to
ski
and
the
data
science
design
manual
In
fact
I
do
like
this
book
four
I
used
it
for
a
number
of
topics
So
if
you
can
find
it
and
you'll
be
able
to
find
it
I
would
suggest
using
this
book
Scanner
is
a
great
author
The
wiki
presents
information
is
very
easy
to
understand
And
they
will
be
the
second
book
that
I
will
show
you
It's
on
the
slides
as
well
Right
here
Now
Bar
charts
bar
charts
as
opposed
to
stack
charts
as
same
bar
turns
his
mom
Now
in
this
case
in
this
case
we'll
look
at
the
number
of
people
that
purchased
tickets
to
titanic
buy
ticket
classes
the
first
class
the
second
the
third
So
that
is
the
first-class
the
whole
bar
Second
in
the
third
Now
the
red
area
represents
the
number
of
people
If
you
look
right
here
that's
the
number
of
people
who
purchase
tickets
to
the
first-class
and
died
as
a
result
of
the
tragedy
on
Titanic
The
blue
is
the
number
of
people
that
survived
Some
information
You
can
read
some
information
from
this
butcher
Now
if
you
change
a
little
bit
the
way
you
are
representing
your
information
too
weird
The
tickets
that
are
purchased
to
the
first
class
second
class
and
third
class
will
be
taken
as
one
each
And
then
he
will
show
the
percent
of
people
of
the
first
class
that
died
of
the
second
class
and
third
class
or
that
died
you
will
see
a
slightly
better
information
You
will
see
immediately
and
understand
immediately
The
higher
the
class
the
richer
you
are
the
higher
the
chance
to
survive
So
before
you
Start
on
your
visuals
First
Don't
look
at
just
numbers
Try
to
understand
what
is
the
idea
that
I
wanted
to
deliver
And
what
you
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
high
percent
of
rich
people
that
survived
then
this
is
probably
what
you
want
to
do
Again
By
the
way
do
you
see
well
on
your
screens
isn't
big
enough
Okay
Next
example
Again
bar
charts
a
little
bit
differently
constructed
but
the
same
word
charts
Now
what
is
shown
right
here
For
each
country
It
is
shown
for
the
number
of
people
that
died
in
World
War
II
This
is
a
red
bar
and
the
gray
bar
is
the
percent
of
the
population
So
the
red
bar
is
the
number
of
people
The
green
bar
is
the
is
the
percent
of
the
population
Do
you
like
this
bar
chart
No
Would
you
use
just
the
same
or
would
you
change
something
If
you
change
why
You're
saying
it's
very
hard
to
read
Just
look
at
the
colors
right
No
longer
red
bar
represents
the
population
For
example
close
to
24
million
people
died
from
Soviet
Union
And
then
so
one
for
each
country
And
the
green
is
the
percent
of
the
population
for
example
about
14%
Soviet
Union
So
assume
it
is
easy
to
read
That's
why
I
asked
you
if
you
can
see
it
well
or
not
Maybe
it's
just
not
the
best
picture
Is
there
anything
else
that
bothers
you
It's
kinda
weird
how
they're
combining
onto
one
skill
like
a
millions
I'm
gonna
percentage
I
agree
I
agree
It's
quite
misleading
When
you
look
at
this
red
and
gray
it
seems
like
Alright
maybe
more
than
half
of
the
population
died
Is
that
what
they
wanna
say
No
actually
it's
just
the
units
right
here
are
different
but
the
numbers
are
the
same
but
the
units
are
different
If
you're
willing
to
understand
of
course
it
can
go
through
this
and
it
has
all
the
correct
information
But
is
the
visual
itself
is
the
greatest
I
wouldn't
use
it
I
wouldn't
do
this
one
Very
representative
But
the
one
thing
that
I
wanted
to
notice
right
here
again
World
War
casualties
Poland
17
2%
of
the
population
Soviet
Union
14
2
Yugoslavia
and
so
on
and
so
forth
So
in
this
case
you
can
see
the
percentage
of
the
population
clearly
Is
there
anything
that
you
noticed
that
you
may
want
to
give
additional
information
about
Probably
if
you
know
a
little
bit
of
history
then
you
would
notice
If
not
then
you
may
not
Nothing
that
you
see
What
do
you
want
to
be
The
Soviet
Union
is
a
huge
country
At
that
point
the
word
15
republics
which
later
became
15
countries
Depends
on
how
you
count
the
number
of
republics
right
here
or
all
added
together
And
we're
told
that
there
are
about
14%
of
the
population
died
But
in
fact
if
you
take
billers
or
sometimes
you
can
hear
bela
russia
by
itself
It
is
going
to
be
on
proportionally
large
percent
of
the
population
that
died
which
is
well
above
the
pole
once
So
you
will
look
at
the
failures
and
you
will
look
at
Ukraine
those
or
two
countries
Well
right
now
there
are
countries
that
were
republics
of
that
time
that
lost
mostly
percentage
wise
Why
Now
when
you
see
this
then
you
go
and
you
read
about
this
period
of
time
and
you
understand
it's
not
enough
just
to
put
the
numbers
on
the
chart
You
need
to
understand
what's
going
on
And
every
time
when
we
have
a
lecture
when
I'm
talking
about
data
science
every
time
I'm
going
to
stress
it
Data
Science
Of
course
it
is
about
the
numbers
about
the
data
about
the
science
about
analysis
Also
you
need
to
understand
what's
going
on
You
need
to
make
sense
of
your
data
Okay
Next
if
your
data
is
given
as
a
table
if
you
receive
the
table
as
your
data
you
should
be
happy
because
it's
easy
to
work
with
But
do
you
want
to
show
it
as
a
table
For
example
you
are
given
a
project
for
question
and
you'd
have
to
perform
some
analysis
And
then
you
have
some
finance
as
the
result
of
your
analysis
Now
it's
time
for
you
to
present
your
findings
present
your
data
Do
you
want
to
present
it
as
a
table
Well
maybe
not
There
are
other
ways
of
doing
it
because
when
you
simply
throw
the
results
into
the
table
I
have
to
go
through
all
of
these
numbers
and
try
to
make
sense
myself
of
what
it
is
you're
trying
to
show
Well
it's
clear
what
this
data
is
in
the
table
We
can
do
it
but
there
are
better
ways
The
first
and
the
easiest
Color
If
you
don't
have
time
you
run
out
of
time
in
1
second
you
have
to
present
it
Let's
change
the
color
But
even
if
you
don't
have
a
lot
of
time
to
think
about
a
better
visual
stay
with
the
same
table
but
use
a
heatmap
This
is
the
same
table
And
Python
can
actually
read
from
your
table
and
assign
a
color
to
each
cell
of
the
table
So
that
what
you
do
one
function
then
you
go
from
this
to
the
vet
Suppose
you
wanted
to
point
out
these
two
events
You
don't
need
to
talk
much
there
already
There
They
will
already
attract
the
viewer's
attention
right
away
Okay
Alright
Another
scatterplots
applauds
We
have
to
numeric
variables
and
we
want
to
show
the
relation
between
them
Very
good
to
use
scatterplots
In
this
case
In
this
case
once
you
plot
them
you
can
see
that
there
is
a
positive
correlation
very
strong
positive
correlation
Now
he
can
say
it
is
a
linear
correlation
We
said
last
time
that
mostly
we
use
the
word
correlation
in
this
class
Point
out
to
the
linear
Now
second
picture
it
is
a
negative
correlation
It
certainly
isn't
strong
or
weak
correlation
but
you
can
see
this
is
a
negative
correlation
and
no
correlation
whatsoever
And
in
this
case
dependence
is
quadratic
or
at
least
it
looks
like
a
quadratic
then
you
may
find
that
it
is
some
sort
of
a
high
degree
polynomial
If
you
plot
more
data
if
you
have
more
data
but
there
is
certainly
a
correlation
And
the
correlation
here
is
not
meaning
you
can
immediately
tell
it
from
debt
So
when
you
just
get
your
data
and
you
see
lots
of
numbers
you're
looking
at
this
numbers
What
do
I
have
there
I
have
no
idea
Somebody
asks
you
to
analyze
it
Start
with
visuals
Well
you
can
start
with
either
summative
statistics
or
with
visuals
You
need
to
do
both
Run
different
visual
analytics
And
maybe
you
will
see
immediately
that
there
is
some
pattern
in
them
data
Which
one
You
don't
know
You
don't
know
Suppose
you
get
a
bunch
of
numbers
How
to
start
where
to
start
where
to
plot
Just
try
Just
try
it
Now
a
scatter
plot
right
here
is
presented
for
two
variables
is
done
for
two
years
You
can
do
it
for
three
variables
where
the
third
you
can
add
the
third
dimension
but
then
it
is
somewhat
different
Difficult
already
To
make
sense
of
the
pattern
what
you
can
do
is
to
present
a
scatterplot
matrix
scatter
plot
matrix
These
are
all
of
the
attributes
or
the
variables
you
construct
at
matrix
These
are
attributes
And
then
each
pair
is
presented
as
a
scatterplot
matrix
Each
pair
of
variables
these
weak
if
there
is
a
strong
relation
between
any
two
then
you
will
spot
it
For
example
right
here
it's
somewhat
weak
but
it
is
a
positive
certainly
positive
correlation
Now
this
matrix
is
symmetric
This
matrix
is
symmetric
Very
useful
Next
time
series
We
talked
a
little
bit
last
time
about
time
series
What
is
good
about
time
series
And
this
is
cardiogram
Also
time-series
What
is
good
about
time
series
You
can
see
you
can
notice
that
trend
whether
it
is
a
cyclic
or
maybe
the
seasonal
weather
Right
here
for
example
You
see
increased
the
value
increases
in
time
decreases
and
times
are
decreases
in
time
or
increases
in
time
Or
maybe
the
reasonable
pattern
you
don't
know
Or
in
this
case
maybe
it
is
not
changing
much
But
the
changes
or
sell
them
or
major
changes
a
seldom
and
you
don't
see
a
pattern
in
them
But
these
three
are
very
representative
of
time
series
The
reason
why
you
may
want
to
use
time
series
Next
everytime
I
show
you
I'm
trying
to
go
one
step
further
These
are
the
same
time
series
but
we
also
added
I
don't
mean
the
same
as
were
on
the
previous
on
the
previous
slide
but
these
are
also
time
series
But
in
this
case
we
added
color
to
the
representation
And
if
you
want
to
look
at
time
series
in
here
per
season
or
per
months
then
it
is
very
easy
to
see
what
you
want
to
deliver
The
temperatures
are
low
right
here
and
towards
the
center
of
the
temperatures
are
going
up
During
the
day
the
temperatures
are
going
up
Of
course
all
of
your
note
that
but
that's
the
reason
why
I
showed
you
this
hit
map
for
time
series
right
here
So
you
can
understand
easily
how
to
use
it
when
to
use
waterfall
chart
Please
tell
me
did
you
see
this
types
of
charts
before
the
waterfall
chart
Do
you
see
it
clearly
Right
here
Can
you
see
it
or
you
want
me
to
increase
Maybe
the
size
like
that
Never
have
Never
have
Okay
Most
of
you
didn't
see
those
Before
I
haven't
seen
this
charts
used
very
frequently
So
for
some
reason
they
are
used
quite
sold
them
in
yet
if
you
understand
how
it
works
it
is
a
great
way
to
present
information
Let
me
explain
to
you
how
it
works
and
you
will
try
to
come
up
with
examples
of
where
you'd
want
to
use
this
type
of
waterfall
charts
I
will
try
to
mask
the
idea
of
what
it
can
be
used
for
So
for
example
we
started
with
something
that
is
50
units
We
gained
40
then
we
gained
therapy
which
resulted
with
a
120
Then
we
gained
1020
and
lost
I
think
it
is
50
Atkins
and
the
result
is
100
Now
this
intermediate
cause
we
can
make
a
decision
whether
you
want
to
include
an
intermediate
column
You
possibly
you
won't
have
Amy
maybe
you
will
have
one
or
two
It's
up
to
you
to
decide
What
do
you
where
do
you
think
is
a
good
time
to
use
this
type
of
charts
And
I
just
said
the
changes
over
different
time
intervals
My
sensor
where
exactly
stock
price
stock
price
For
stock
market
it's
very
representative
That's
a
great
way
to
present
the
changes
Because
here
you
don't
really
concentrate
on
the
numbers
You
see
in
grows
quite
a
bit
more
Then
it
goes
down
And
you
see
what
we
started
with
what
we
ended
with
So
it's
a
great
way
to
present
that
type
of
information
Let's
continue
Another
one
that
you
probably
have
not
seen
before
Let
me
see
Maybe
it's
not
big
enough
Is
it
good
enough
Alright
Getting
ready
I
can
increase
my
alright
Spider
chart
Have
you
seen
this
one
before
Yes
Okay
Some
of
you
did
Okay
Now
this
is
something
that
you
want
to
experiment
with
What
is
the
spider
chart
to
go
into
show
competitor
analysis
spider
term
product
one
product
two
product
three
We're
looking
at
the
three
products
We
are
comparing
the
products
or
marketing
strategy
or
whatever
you
decide
to
compare
about
this
products
Now
put
the
number
right
here
a
variable
or
the
number
of
products
in
this
case
should
not
be
large
or
else
you're
going
to
lose
information
here
You
will
not
be
able
to
make
sense
But
when
the
number
is
three
for
example
then
it
is
very
nice
Now
these
are
attributes
is
you
notice
the
number
of
attributes
right
here
is
also
not
very
large
123456788
is
fine
I
would
say
maybe
five
to
ten
is
okay
In
the
number
of
products
inside
in
this
case
or
the
number
of
data
data
points
is
not
large
In
this
case
we
have
three
products
and
we're
going
to
compare
them
How
are
they
compared
in
price
The
green
one
is
for
the
yellow
to
the
blue
one
now
is
at
$1
to
four
What
do
you
think
it
is
Some
sort
of
relative
scale
I
don't
think
it
really
matters
what
the
number
is
as
long
as
we
can
compare
each
products
to
each
other
True
too
So
it
could
be
some
sort
of
a
rating
It
could
be
some
sort
of
a
relative
number
right
In
this
case
But
to
a
lot
of
times
we
can't
compare
when
we're
dealing
with
a
rating
In
any
case
you
can
see
that
the
green
one
wins
here
Here
there
is
first
advertisement
not
so
much
As
far
as
the
service
It's
at
the
bottom
well
together
with
a
blue
one
and
then
so
on
and
so
forth
So
you
can
go
and
compare
Now
if
you're
choosing
between
23
cars
which
one
you
want
to
buy
then
probably
that's
the
best
thing
to
do
Because
it's
easy
to
make
a
decision
in
that
case
Now
look
at
this
one
Apple
versus
Samsung
Apple
versus
Samsung
You
can
represent
the
same
information
with
a
Boucher
This
is
for
simpson
This
is
for
iPhone
Is
it
good
bad
Well
in
this
case
I
really
don't
care
about
the
bar
chart
because
what
it
compare
right
here
is
not
comparable
What
do
I
compare
that
display
quality
to
the
processor
I
don't
really
compare
them
I
can
see
how
they
are
being
rated
but
it
doesn't
tell
me
much
if
I'm
trying
to
make
a
decision
between
A
symptom
phone
or
iPhone
This
is
a
little
better
As
far
as
the
design
Most
people
like
Samsung
As
far
as
the
price
Well
they
about
the
same
No
I'm
not
saying
it's
not
my
opinion
It
is
not
any
kind
of
late
time
I
would
say
rating
It
is
just
I've
read
in
from
the
chart
As
far
as
the
camera
Samson's
cameras
better
right
here
you
can
see
the
processor
the
processors
or
about
the
same
So
according
to
this
chart
it
looks
like
Samsung
is
better
overall
Well
it's
not
true
But
according
to
this
chart
Samsung
is
better
You
can
always
manipulate
your
data
And
if
you
work
for
SAMHSA
that
would
be
a
great
church
Especially
if
you
know
that
iPhone
is
better
in
some
areas
you
can
just
usefully
forget
this
areas
right
So
sometimes
it
depends
on
how
you
represent
your
data
You
can
sell
anything
to
anybody
As
data
scientists
you
want
it
to
be
honest
and
you
want
to
know
especially
when
somebody's
trying
to
sell
anything
to
you
you
want
to
be
aware
of
it
You
try
So
let's
fill
in
anything
to
me
You
will
hurt
You
will
have
a
hard
time
Okay
And
I
want
you
to
be
that
way
to
analyze
analyze
do
not
trust
anything
Analyze
yourself
Alright
Another
kind
parallel
coordinates
plot
Parallel
coordinates
plot
Alright
we
have
two
items
a
yellow
item
and
a
blue
item
Again
this
one
is
useful
when
you
compare
and
maybe
2-3
for
products
Now
these
are
the
attributes
These
are
the
variables
or
attributes
If
you
compare
for
example
you're
buying
two
cars
and
one
is
the
one
variables
is
a
mileage
and
so
on
and
so
forth
Okay
So
then
you
can
see
how
they're
compared
when
one
is
better
than
the
other
And
on
that
basis
you
already
can
make
a
decision
It
is
useful
when
you
don't
have
too
many
variables
It
is
useful
when
you
don't
have
too
many
products
Here
you
see
there
are
two
items
That's
clear
Now
This
you
may
say
it's
not
clear
because
you
have
too
many
items
On
the
other
hand
while
this
one
is
still
good
and
still
clear
Because
even
though
these
are
being
different
items
they
all
belong
to
the
same
cluster
of
items
Then
in
this
case
what
you
want
to
deliver
is
how
Classes
You
can
look
into
this
example
more
If
you
look
at
the
following
data
set
a
very
famous
Irish
statistic
from
UCI
In
fact
you
say
repository
has
a
lot
of
datasets
And
if
you
ever
want
to
do
a
project
or
just
to
play
with
some
data
you
can
always
use
UCI
repository
You
can
find
something
useful
for
permanently
for
machine
learning
projects
So
this
is
the
famous
iris
data
set
The
information
is
collected
on
the
flower
on
iris
That
pedal
length
and
so
on
and
so
forth
If
you
take
a
fluorine
you
don't
know
which
type
in
which
species
it
belongs
to
And
you
plot
this
the
values
for
the
variables
on
the
following
chart
It
will
give
you
for
the
answer
to
your
question
which
species
it
most
likely
belongs
to
Okay
Because
if
it
follows
the
yellow
pattern
then
it
is
this
Get
exposed
in
green
parents
14
wherever
its
color
then
it
is
insulin
Again
Be
careful
with
parallel
coordinates
So
in
this
case
when
we
have
a
number
of
course
right
here
being
compared
in
this
case
it's
already
very
difficult
to
make
sense
If
you
are
looking
at
the
course
of
the
same
10K
for
example
For
example
this
three
belong
to
the
same
make
this
35
belong
to
a
different
one
but
then
change
the
color
for
them
And
it
will
become
much
more
representative
Pie
charts
Well
you
can
see
pie
charts
are
evil
Yes
No
It's
a
matter
of
opinion
of
course
is
a
matter
of
opinion
But
now
for
the
following
few
slides
I
used
this
book
Storytelling
with
Data
I
advise
you
to
look
at
this
book
You
can
read
it
in
probably
an
hour
It
is
very
useful
just
runs
through
it
And
you
will
see
some
examples
of
visuals
How
to
use
the
wind
to
use
them
You
may
want
to
find
something
useful
from
that
book
I'm
sure
you
will
find
something
here
so
it
is
very
very
easy
to
to
read
I
advise
you
to
to
look
into
it
Again
that
the
books
that
I've
shown
you
either
they're
free
or
you
can
just
connect
to
your
series
libraries
through
VPN
And
it
will
allow
you
to
read
those
books
You
can
always
access
them
was
1
Now
the
author
of
this
book
says
the
pie
charts
are
evil
Well
she's
very
opinionated
towards
or
rather
against
pie
charts
I
wouldn't
be
saying
don't
use
them
ever
forever
and
ever
She
gives
some
very
good
examples
of
where
pie
charts
certainly
should
not
be
used
Especially
3D
point
shirts
three
d
pie
charts
are
very
misleading
very
misleading
Supply
marketshare
Look
at
a
and
which
one
is
it
can
be
And
even
I
guess
it
is
a
team
Which
one
is
greater
by
hut
by
how
much
can
we
tell
from
it
Now
if
we
put
a
percentage
right
here
it
looks
like
this
one
is
And
think
it
chunk
But
if
you
still
look
there
then
the
blue
one
small
So
you
can
see
that
you're
honest
waited
and
always
As
always
If
you
want
to
lie
you're
welcome
to
use
this
kind
of
a
pie
chart
What
does
it
say
about
2D
pie
charts
Okay
let's
get
to
the
2D
pie
charts
Now
even
was
3D
pie
charts
sometimes
you
can
make
a
point
But
this
is
the
case
where
you
should
not
use
it
if
you
don't
want
to
live
with
it
To
d
pie
charts
Now
this
one
is
really
just
not
useful
because
you
can
not
read
that
Now
Can
you
compare
this
Well
it's
probably
as
good
as
just
simply
writing
it
line
by
line
And
these
are
all
the
examples
from
that
book
And
I
do
advise
you
to
go
and
look
through
that
book
It's
very
useful
Okay
Now
this
one
is
a
little
bit
easier
to
comprehend
But
so
this
is
the
survey
results
So
there
was
some
sort
of
a
training
And
before
the
training
and
after
the
train
The
same
information
is
presented
as
a
set
of
two
is
a
set
of
several
Buy
Charts
The
comparison
before
and
after
before
and
after
before
imposture
This
is
a
better
way
to
deliver
again
to
deliver
the
information
what
you
wanted
to
do
you
wanted
to
compare
the
attitude
to
something
before
and
after
This
pie
chart
is
telling
you
about
before
this
one
about
after
Or
does
it
have
information
in
it
Yes
it
does
But
what
you
want
to
point
out
is
how
the
attitude
to
something
changed
But
then
you
want
to
combined
before
and
after
and
showed
you
show
the
change
right
So
this
one
is
easy
to
read
Now
suppose
you
have
a
bike
quite
charts
just
a
regular
co-chair
of
that
You
see
a
lot
of
times
let's
say
a
number
of
female
students
in
CS
compared
to
the
number
of
male
students
Then
maybe
you
will
see
I
don't
know
the
numbers
I'm
not
ready
to
give
you
the
exact
percentage
It
will
be
waived
worse
than
that
If
we're
talking
about
CS
Engineering
it
will
be
worse
than
that
and
we're
concerned
about
it
We
want
to
bring
more
female
students
But
in
any
case
whatever
it
is
it
is
a
great
representation
I
think
in
this
case
pie
chart
is
not
evil
So
when
you
want
to
show
what
part
of
a
whole
different
group
is
taken
And
there
were
not
so
many
groups
in
the
very
incompatible
in
sizes
than
pie
charts
are
good
In
this
case
you
would
deliver
the
message
with
the
PyCharm
That's
my
opinion
You're
welcome
Too
heavy
on
heatmaps
Back
to
the
heatmaps
You
can
use
different
colors
for
Heatmaps
But
do
you
want
to
what
it
is
You
can
tell
with
this
hit
map
well
there's
something
run
there's
something
purple
Who
knows
what
they
are
If
I
look
at
the
numbers
I'll
understand
the
numbers
but
I
might
as
well
live
it
as
a
table
because
I
don't
know
how
to
compare
How
do
you
compare
this
red
with
this
purple
I
don't
know
Right
So
if
you
want
to
give
some
sort
of
a
comparison
then
it's
better
to
use
different
shades
or
different
intensity
of
the
same
color
In
this
case
you
deliver
more
information
and
what
you
want
what
you
want
to
tell
what
you
want
to
with
the
information
that
you
want
to
give
the
person
that
is
looking
at
it
should
be
able
to
just
look
for
a
second
and
get
your
point
That's
the
best
type
of
a
visual
Now
if
I
want
to
know
more
I
will
read
through
it
and
I
will
understand
of
course
what
are
the
differences
in
someone
But
I
just
look
and
I
see
alright
this
catches
my
attention
Then
I
see
this
is
all
white
Now
I
agreed
what
are
the
differences
But
I
see
that
picture
from
there
But
ready
And
the
last
slide
again
again
a
table
another
table
and
a
heatmap
Especially
if
you're
using
Python
it
doesn't
take
any
more
than
a
minute
to
turn
this
table
to
this
heatmap
which
is
the
same
table
but
just
enhanced
with
color
Alright
I'm
going
to
stop
right
now
