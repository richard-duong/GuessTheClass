your
lumps
on
your
labs
The
extension
hopefully
helped
you
finished
what
you
were
supposed
to
finish
Jury
is
going
to
have
office
hours
today
He
open
to
office
hours
but
if
you
can't
make
it
and
if
you
meet
him
later
you
can
message
him
and
he's
willing
to
do
more
today
He
said
he's
quite
free
today
So
if
you
need
a
different
time
please
ask
him
Okay
Now
next
quiz
is
posted
It's
due
tomorrow
night
You
saw
that
two
You're
going
to
have
your
first
midterm
We
could
five
So
it's
not
next
week
the
week
after
the
next
week
And
that's
about
it
We're
going
to
work
on
data
collection
I
switched
from
probability
to
data
collection
But
then
we're
going
to
cover
one
more
test
that
is
used
in
statistics
And
that
requires
some
probability
statistics
So
I
deliberately
I
am
not
going
to
cover
it
right
now
I
want
you
to
feel
calm
comfortable
with
what
we
started
I
want
you
to
finish
this
quiz
and
make
sure
that
you
understand
the
last
two
the
last
two
parts
of
the
lecture
that
we
covered
last
time
And
after
that
probably
on
Monday
I
will
cover
this
last
piece
that
goes
towards
Statistics
and
Probability
Don't
want
to
call
it
with
the
lecture
today
is
very
easy
But
I
would
say
it
should
be
useful
We're
going
to
talk
very
useful
for
those
who
are
going
to
go
into
data
science
field
We're
going
to
talk
about
data
collection
There
are
different
ways
of
collecting
data
And
first
of
all
it
depends
on
what
type
of
data
you
need
to
collect
You
may
be
Researcher
in
chemistry
biology
And
I'm
not
going
to
help
you
with
data
collection
in
that
area
because
I
don't
understand
much
in
that
area
And
I
understand
that
You
don't
understand
either
So
in
that
area
especially
should
work
on
data
collection
In
fact
in
each
ear
it's
very
useful
if
the
first
steps
are
done
by
specialists
who
knows
exactly
what
they
are
doing
We're
going
to
talk
about
somewhat
different
type
of
data
collection
We
will
start
with
surveys
And
data
simply
Just
to
make
sure
that
you
remember
data
can
be
primary
and
secondary
Secondary
data
is
the
data
that
was
collected
by
you
or
someone
else
and
that
was
used
before
And
primary
data
is
data
that
is
collected
by
for
example
u
And
it
is
the
first-hand
experience
And
this
is
what
we
are
going
to
concentrate
on
right
now
We're
simply
going
to
talk
about
surveys
to
start
with
A
population
and
a
sample
Suppose
you
have
a
question
and
your
question
is
about
a
point
of
view
Some
views
some
maybe
statistics
on
a
population
of
the
United
States
Does
it
mean
that
you
are
going
to
ask
every
attempt
to
answer
your
question
Well
you
me
We
do
it
at
least
once
every
couple
of
years
But
it
is
very
very
tedious
process
So
usually
it's
not
done
that
way
Usually
he
would
like
to
find
some
simple
that
There's
going
to
be
representative
of
the
population
that
you
want
to
question
The
results
depend
on
how
well
you
sample
For
example
you
want
to
learn
about
let's
say
about
the
political
views
but
not
go
very
far
about
the
political
views
of
the
United
States
residents
And
you're
going
to
say
well
it's
quite
complicated
process
to
ask
everybody
I
live
in
California
and
in
fact
I'm
a
history
student
Why
don't
I
just
you
see
your
students
In
fact
maybe
I'll
just
asked
students
from
my
class
is
going
to
be
quite
representative
Willard
or
will
it
not
in
y
So
if
you
ask
everybody
in
your
class
or
even
if
you
ask
everybody
at
you
Sierra
roughly
everybody
whoever
you
can
get
to
answer
isn't
going
to
represent
the
views
of
all
population
of
the
United
States
Probably
not
know
why
Certain
states
and
probably
different
states
tend
to
be
Even
if
we're
simply
talking
I'm
simplifying
it
but
it's
going
to
deliver
the
point
Even
if
we're
simply
talking
about
being
who
belongs
to
the
Democratic
Party
or
the
Republican
Party
We
know
that
some
states
are
Democratic
or
Republican
next
So
it's
the
state
and
geographic
location
What
else
A
younger
audience
Right
It's
going
to
probably
a
younger
audience
It's
going
to
be
18
to
maybe
most
of
the
students
18
to
25
Of
course
there
are
oldest
students
but
that
is
going
to
be
a
huge
chunk
of
the
data
So
what
this
younger
populations
links
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
older
population
views
So
it's
good
to
be
different
And
as
you
point
the
point
that
educational
levels
as
well
So
it
is
important
before
you
conduct
your
survey
You
study
it's
important
to
understand
what
is
your
population
and
then
decide
on
the
simple
the
techniques
of
sampling
We're
going
to
look
at
the
techniques
right
now
We're
going
to
check
two
types
of
techniques
probabilistic
techniques
and
non-probabilistic
techniques
You're
going
to
tell
me
why
the
following
technique
may
work
or
may
not
work
Is
it
good
or
not
Sometimes
sometimes
some
very
simple
technique
that
seems
like
it's
not
going
to
good
it's
not
going
to
be
a
very
representative
It
may
work
So
you
need
to
think
you
need
to
know
Let's
look
at
this
example
We
can
talk
telephone
survey
to
find
out
about
the
credit
use
of
households
in
columns
We
take
a
simple
random
sample
of
listings
in
the
white
pages
of
the
telephone
book
Simple
random
sample
We
open
the
book
and
say
here
I'm
going
to
call
this
person
Alright
Alright
Is
it
going
to
be
representative
of
the
population
Is
this
a
useful
sampling
technique
Or
it
may
suffer
from
some
problems
What
do
you
think
Okay
what
kind
of
problems
And
great
people
with
no
phone
or
it
skews
towards
those
who
own
businesses
And
that
is
true
too
And
if
your
phone
is
not
in
this
book
then
you
certainly
not
going
to
be
called
right
Okay
next
example
Suppose
the
survey
organization
conducts
a
telephone
survey
and
asked
respondents
how
many
hours
a
week
they
work
The
interviewers
themselves
work
from
nine
to
five
Monday
through
Friday
So
this
is
the
time
that
they
work
They
call
people
from
nine
to
five
Monday
through
Friday
And
they
ask
them
about
the
number
of
hours
in
English
that
they
work
Is
it
a
biased
survey
Are
they
going
to
have
information
that
is
going
to
represent
the
population
or
not
Why
not
Why
not
People
will
be
working
when
they
call
so
they
won't
even
be
able
to
pick
up
Okay
Those
that
work
from
nine
to
five
they
will
never
be
available
And
then
you
are
removing
from
your
sample
all
those
people
That
work
nine
to
five
Monday
through
Friday
Right
Now
some
of
this
sampling
bias
that
you
also
need
to
think
whether
it
is
intentional
bias
or
non-intentional
buys
Remember
you
can
always
conduct
an
interview
or
survey
If
you
want
to
skew
your
data
It's
always
possible
If
a
person
is
a
dishonest
researcher
it's
always
possible
to
intentionally
skew
the
results
This
is
not
what
we're
talking
about
right
now
with
talking
about
those
researchers
that
honestly
trying
to
conduct
a
survey
and
they
are
taken
they
think
is
a
very
representative
But
the
results
may
come
out
not
quite
what
they
want
for
not
quite
representing
the
situation
because
they
didn't
think
about
sampling
for
long
enough
And
here
you
can
see
interviews
and
responders
can
also
skew
the
outcome
of
the
survey
Why
Thinking
about
this
occasion
Somebody's
asking
you
a
question
It
may
be
an
interviewer
server
or
it
is
some
sort
of
astronomy
But
when
the
question
is
asked
personally
and
do
in
a
conversation
a
person
says
by
the
way
were
you
born
in
you
realize
that
you
were
born
in
the
same
city
Don't
you
think
that
somehow
you
will
tend
to
agree
with
his
views
Now
if
you
are
certain
about
your
instrument
then
probably
not
But
if
you
think
this
way
may
be
stepped
way
I'm
not
quite
sure
You
will
tend
to
agree
with
the
interior
If
you
find
something
in
common
if
you
find
that
you
like
the
interviewer
and
so
on
So
this
may
be
biased
which
means
that
if
you
want
to
eliminate
that
maybe
some
interview
that
eliminates
a
person
of
the
interviewer
may
be
some
that
you'll
go
into
science
Some
interview
that
you're
going
to
send
simply
is
going
to
be
better
in
this
case
And
another
one
is
far
as
responders
maybe
I
don't
want
to
tell
the
truth
Maybe
I
feel
that
Well
if
I
said
that
how's
he
going
to
look
at
me
So
this
kind
of
attitude
may
also
skew
the
results
Well
maybe
I
simply
forgot
Now
as
I
said
we're
going
to
look
at
two
types
of
simply
probabilistic
and
non-probabilistic
sampling
Probabilistic
When
we
conduct
to
simply
we
know
exactly
what
is
the
probability
of
a
particular
group
or
a
person
depending
on
the
service
is
to
be
selected
And
when
it
is
non-probabilistic
then
we
don't
have
random
sampling
Random
sampling
All
right
we
have
12
people
here
We
know
we
need
four
for
our
simple
We
just
take
four
of
this
12
at
random
And
as
you
can
see
in
a
class
for
example
we
have
40
students
or
right
now
exactly
right
now
we
have
40
students
I
read
the
names
put
them
in
the
head
and
they'd
just
pull
item
behead
thought
five
names
and
ask
questions
Ok
so
it
is
random
sampling
First
question
why
it
may
be
good
Please
talk
say
something
More
accurate
data
removed
some
elements
of
bias
Bias
of
picking
the
response
right
No
favoring
correct
no
variables
Okay
What
would
you
say
is
the
biggest
advantage
of
such
sibling
of
this
advantage
of
such
simply
equal
representation
of
the
population
The
civic
question
It's
simple
It's
simple
It
is
simple
So
dependent
on
what
exactly
you
want
to
ask
You
may
use
random
sampling
Now
Well
it
is
very
simple
There
is
nothing
to
do
There
is
no
preparation
You
know
the
probability
of
each
student
in
our
case
each
student
to
be
to
be
chosen
and
so
on
Can
you
give
me
an
example
S2
When
you
don't
want
to
use
random
sampling
for
example
I
would
like
to
get
an
answer
to
this
question
and
I
will
conduct
to
a
random
sampling
Now
show
me
when
this
sampling
is
not
going
to
be
representative
It
does
guarantee
distribution
of
the
sample
size
is
large
enough
That
is
true
I
thought
It's
actually
complicated
because
it's
not
always
easy
to
get
it
completely
random
Well
that
is
somewhat
true
But
for
our
purposes
if
we
do
have
40
students
in
the
class
and
if
we
do
it
this
way
then
it
is
pretty
random
Now
when
you
wanted
to
analyze
a
specific
group
or
population
but
it's
not
finished
So
what
happens
when
you
want
to
analyze
a
specific
group
or
population
Using
simple
random
sampling
won't
give
you
a
good
representation
of
the
groups
Will
give
you
what
won't
give
you
a
good
representation
of
the
groups
will
not
give
you
a
good
representation
of
the
groups
The
easiest
example
right
here
that
obvious
example
of
right
here
Suppose
we
want
to
For
example
we
want
to
learn
if
point
of
view
of
female
students
And
you
know
that
the
population
of
female
students
at
UC
are
in
C
is
clauses
It's
just
horribly
under-represented
So
if
I
randomly
pick
ten
students
out
of
40
I
will
have
only
very
low
percent
of
female
students
if
any
And
we
are
going
to
be
under-represented
as
usual
Right
Well
when
we're
talking
about
a
group
of
female
students
being
net
percentage
wise
much
lower
and
then
a
group
of
male
students
So
in
this
case
we
don't
want
to
use
grandmom
simpler
Think
about
your
question
Think
about
your
population
They
have
read
time
when
you
conduct
your
serving
Alright
Next
stratified
sampling
Stratified
simply
So
what
do
we
do
right
here
We
split
the
population
into
groups
And
then
we
will
pick
from
each
group
We
will
pick
randomly
at
that
point
some
members
If
you
can
see
12
students
12
people
right
here
split
into
four
groups
and
we
picked
one
into
the
simple
All
right
Why
it
is
good
What
you
said
before
If
we
have
different
groups
then
we
certainly
are
going
to
have
representatives
from
each
group
in
simple
random
sample
can
miss
those
A
stratified
sample
It's
not
going
to
miss
those
because
for
example
we're
going
to
split
male
and
female
students
or
students
from
different
origins
into
different
groups
And
we
will
make
sure
that
every
group
will
send
a
representative
into
the
center
Right
So
sometimes
you
may
want
to
think
about
stratified
sampling
as
opposed
to
just
simple
random
sampling
cluster
sampling
Cluster
sampling
we
divide
all
the
population
in
the
groups
Again
just
like
in
stratified
sampling
But
we're
not
looking
for
representatives
from
each
group
Instead
with
taken
several
of
this
group's
completely
And
an
example
that
is
given
here
is
an
airline
company
wants
to
serve
its
customers
one
day
So
they
randomly
select
five
flights
for
the
day
And
the
survey
every
passenger
on
those
flights
for
example
they
have
a
100
flights
They
randomly
picked
five
in
then
the
surveyed
all
people
on
those
flights
When
is
it
not
good
Give
me
one
example
right
here
for
this
particular
example
When
this
is
not
going
to
work
your
clusters
could
be
selected
in
a
way
that
excludes
a
certain
group
for
example
automotive
sectors
and
there'd
be
locally
representatives
right
So
if
we
have
a
normal
day
and
we
know
that
to
all
of
those
flights
were
the
same
all
of
the
machines
all
of
the
planes
are
the
same
And
technically
the
population
or
the
passengers
on
each
flight
or
the
BOD
of
course
they're
not
about
the
same
And
the
question
is
not
sensitive
very
sensitive
to
let's
say
where
the
slightest
goal
So
in
that
case
it's
very
good
If
we
know
that
it
is
probably
sometimes
it
happens
is
special
day
and
there
were
a
lot
of
let's
say
personal
jets
right
here
So
right
here
it
can
be
also
skewed
but
sometimes
it
is
going
to
work
and
it
may
be
very
very
easy
to
do
the
sampling
this
way
For
example
the
same
at
you
sir
It
you
see
are
maybe
let's
say
we
have
12
thousand
of
classes
If
you
continue
Serbian
in
each
class
First
of
all
it's
a
lot
of
time
of
course
a
lot
of
time
a
lot
of
data
Maybe
we
just
want
to
have
a
quick
survey
and
we
don't
need
to
spend
so
much
time
so
much
And
asked
for
many
people
to
do
so
And
some
people
are
going
to
be
constantly
serve
it
If
I
keep
going
to
or
from
one
cluster
another
for
example
I
go
to
11115
then
I
will
go
to
100
And
it
happens
that
some
students
are
taken
all
of
those
clauses
So
we
will
end
up
with
some
results
multiple
results
from
the
same
students
and
so
on
But
probably
I
can
just
pick
particular
classes
that
meet
at
ten
o'clock
today
And
I
will
pick
five
classes
out
of
those
and
I
will
ask
a
question
So
in
some
situations
it
may
work
Maybe
if
I
ask
a
question
something
about
non-related
to
studies
let's
say
about
either
house
in
maybe
or
maybe
Some
food
court
questions
that
do
not
necessarily
they
are
not
necessarily
connected
to
a
major
They
did
that
was
going
to
work
And
that's
going
to
be
some
simple
enough
right
Alright
systematic
sampling
is
very
very
similar
to
the
random
sampling
But
in
this
case
we
somehow
order
all
the
participants
For
example
students
in
class
just
order
them
according
to
their
names
and
give
a
number
for
they
just
numbered
And
I'm
going
to
say
I
will
pick
the
first
students
randomly
from
one
to
ten
Let's
say
a
student
that
has
number
seven
And
then
I
will
pick
all
students
that
are
ten
away
from
that
students
So
I
will
pick
71727
and
so
on
So
it
is
a
systematic
sampling
I
I
know
Alex
mentioned
that
random
sample
and
is
not
quite
random
In
this
case
It's
a
little
bit
at
least
you
will
believe
that
there
is
a
little
more
randomness
to
it
even
though
it
is
systematic
Now
even
here
you
can
always
argues
me
Because
if
you
have
a
group
of
students
of
a
particular
origin
that
tend
to
have
names
that
start
with
a
particular
letter
In
that
case
it's
going
to
be
biased
You
can
never
what
Vice
completely
but
you
can
try
Alright
Now
we're
going
to
look
at
to
those
sampling
techniques
that
are
not
probabilist
non-probabilistic
In
this
case
I
cannot
give
a
probability
with
which
it
participant
will
get
or
each
person
will
become
a
participant
of
disturbing
a
convenience
sample
I'm
going
to
go
outside
For
example
you
see
are
the
only
reason
I
continue
using
your
sarah
because
this
is
one
place
that
hopefully
a
lot
of
you
know
maybe
some
of
you
still
don't
if
you
transfer
students
But
maybe
I'm
going
to
get
out
of
let's
say
of
our
building
of
CS
I
will
I
will
serve
a
students
that
walk
by
I
don't
know
what
kind
of
service
isn't
going
to
work
Is
it
going
to
work
So
I'll
just
stand
outside
of
Winston
charcoal
which
is
our
CS
building
I
will
survey
those
students
that
walk
by
Is
it
going
to
be
biased
unbiased
to
biased
Why
Because
students
have
particular
major
students
of
CS
major
or
going
to
be
it
higher
advantage
And
most
of
the
students
are
going
to
be
seen
as
students
right
here
So
it
does
if
it
doesn't
matter
to
me
then
it's
going
to
be
okay
For
example
again
if
I'm
talking
about
their
food
habits
even
though
it
we
can
go
deeper
into
this
question
we
can
understand
that
even
in
that
case
it
may
be
biased
as
well
but
sometimes
it
can
work
For
example
if
a
researcher
is
asking
people
inside
of
a
particular
mall
you
know
when
they
Serbian
political
views
they
sometimes
well
before
calving
they
would
park
themselves
in
malls
is
advice
to
not
well
And
not
that
bad
but
still
it
is
biased
All
Convenience
Sampling
is
biased
Now
what
else
Voluntary
response
If
you
agree
if
you
want
to
vote
for
this
candidate
if
you
want
to
give
you
a
pinion
dial
this
for
example
So
you
can
understand
that
in
a
lot
of
cases
it
may
not
have
forming
or
Teller
plan
may
be
busy
may
be
traveling
and
so
on
So
it
is
not
the
best
way
of
sampling
Now
each
of
this
sampling
techniques
exist
and
you
can
always
use
each
of
these
techniques
You
just
need
to
know
the
positive
and
the
negative
and
went
when
to
use
them
Because
sometimes
they
do
work
judgment
and
snowball
sampling
judgment
I
think
this
person
will
be
good
for
my
survey
I
think
that
person
will
be
good
That's
judgement
And
snowball
sampling
I
decide
on
the
first
tier
of
verse
founders
for
example
I
pick
the
first
five
people
to
be
in
my
sample
And
then
I
asked
each
of
those
to
pick
five
people
each
So
that
would
be
a
snowball
sampling
And
each
of
those
five
we'll
pick
each
of
those
25
will
pick
five
each
and
so
on
So
of
course
those
supplies
but
sometimes
they
may
want
Now
when
for
example
that's
the
simplest
out
of
those
with
this
convenience
simply
Nate
work
When
would
you
say
what
is
a
positive
feature
of
this
convenience
sampling
For
positive
features
of
this
convenience
simply
I
think
it's
just
dependent
on
what
you
are
trying
to
get
out
of
the
sampling
right
But
what
is
First
let's
start
What
is
positive
about
it
Why
would
we
want
to
sometimes
conduct
Convenience
Sampling
even
though
we
know
it
can
be
horribly
biased
Theoretically
easier
to
get
data
Absolutely
it
is
very
easy
You
just
get
out
of
wherever
you
are
and
start
asking
questions
Or
find
more
or
less
suitable
location
You
don't
need
to
do
a
particular
preparation
of
a
certainly
you
don't
need
to
get
data
on
on
on
the
people
that
you
want
to
serve
it
those
emails
you
don't
need
to
find
a
way
to
sand
and
to
collect
and
so
on
So
it's
easy
Now
it
is
horribly
biased
And
lot
of
times
when
would
you
want
to
use
it
Probably
on
a
focus
sample
group
depending
on
what
your
target
is
and
what
an
a
focus
sample
group
Well
that's
true
that's
true
But
still
you
can
not
getting
good
representation
no
matter
what
you're
targeting
Yeah
it
wouldn't
be
a
good
representation
But
from
your
example
before
if
you're
standing
outside
of
Winston
Jiang
Hall
you
would
have
that
skewed
data
where
it's
not
truly
randomized
or
it's
still
within
that
that
focus
sample
group
To
some
degree
It
may
not
be
fully
but
that's
that
would
be
the
majority
Right
Still
I
don't
know
7
May
6
be
refined
and
M
five
exits
maybe
Auto
Winston
Chang
independent
and
where
you
stand
and
you're
not
even
going
to
get
a
good
representation
of
CS
students
So
you're
not
going
to
get
a
good
representation
in
any
case
Why
Sometimes
you
still
may
want
to
use
somebody
ask
d
like
this
cheese
That's
a
good
example
by
the
way
When
the
bias
has
no
effect
on
the
data
Well
bias
always
has
effect
on
the
data
But
maybe
what
you
meant
is
correct
If
you're
trying
to
prove
something
I
you
know
movie
suddenly
scheme
you
can
go
to
a
specific
location
and
just
get
people
who
you
know
will
like
participate
and
prove
your
point
But
that
may
be
then
the
researcher
himself
was
not
very
honest
right
So
if
your
only
goal
is
to
prove
your
point
then
you
can
always
figure
out
where
to
go
to
do
that
What's
your
name
here
For
convenience
sampling
What's
your
overall
question
here
The
question
is
when
would
you
want
to
use
convenience
sampling
When
is
it
OK
You
can
use
it
as
a
precursor
to
more
advanced
sampling
So
exactly
exactly
was
just
gonna
say
yes
yes
So
you
are
all
get
into
it
right
now
If
you
are
not
quite
sure
what
to
ask
on
your
main
survey
you
are
just
touching
and
trying
And
you
wanted
the
first
opinion
You're
just
prepare
yourself
even
with
the
cheese
example
you
want
to
ask
And
if
you
see
that
out
of
a
100
people
that
you
ask
to
try
the
cheese
99
said
that
it
is
horrible
Then
maybe
the
store
doesn't
isn't
going
to
even
try
to
carry
this
cheese
right
So
it's
good
enough
and
the
example
is
good
But
for
example
a
company
well
let's
even
say
Apple
or
Samsung
They
wanted
to
bring
a
new
product
to
the
market
and
they
grab
all
these
people
and
they
ask
her
would
you
like
something
like
this
to
be
on
the
market
And
let's
say
90
out
of
a
100
will
say
yes
then
they
can
continue
with
this
survey
They
can
think
about
better
questions
more
specific
questions
that
are
talking
about
some
technical
details
and
so
on
and
so
forth
and
some
costly
survey
But
if
the
answer
immediately
is
going
to
be
no
by
95
5%
we'll
say
maybe
they
will
think
that
maybe
it's
not
Goodman
Let's
forget
about
it
So
it
can
be
pre-survey
It
is
very
cheap
very
fast
very
easy
to
conduct
So
don't
completely
throw
it
out
It
may
be
useful
All
right
Some
examples
I'm
not
going
to
give
you
The
interests
may
be
you
will
may
be
you
will
not
And
after
that
I
have
several
minutes
to
talk
about
something
Each
student
at
a
school
has
a
student
identification
number
Counselors
have
a
computer
and
they're
good
to
generate
50
random
identification
numbers
And
those
students
are
asked
to
take
the
survey
What
type
of
sampling
is
this
All
of
your
say
in
simple
random
sampling
Okay
Simple
random
sample
A
principal
orders
t-shirts
and
wants
to
check
some
of
them
to
make
sure
they
were
printed
properly
She
randomly
selects
two
of
the
ten
boxes
of
shirts
and
checks
every
shirt
in
those
two
boxes
Cluster
CCC
cluster
A
school
chooses
three
randomly
selected
athletes
from
each
of
its
sports
teams
to
participate
in
a
survey
about
athletics
at
a
school
What
type
Stratified
Okay
great
Alright
So
what
I
would
like
you
to
what
I
would
like
to
talk
about
right
now
I'm
not
going
to
go
to
data
processing
today
That's
going
to
be
the
next
time
we're
going
to
finish
data
processing
and
the
testing
that
I
told
you
about
at
the
beginning
of
class
And
then
you
will
have
your
midterm
It's
going
to
be
on
week
five
Right
now
I
think
it
will
be
on
Monday
week
five
Monday
I
will
tell
you
which
lecture
is
going
to
be
the
last
one
So
it
will
be
this
data
pre-processing
plus
some
technique
that
I
included
into
into
the
lecture
statistics
By
the
way
I
uploaded
the
slides
I
just
divided
them
a
little
differently
If
you
want
you
can
upload
from
Google
Trends
In
what
I
would
like
you
to
do
after
we
finish
this
I
would
like
you
to
write
a
survey
This
survey
I
will
allow
you
to
group
for
example
in
groups
of
five
that's
fine
I
will
post
something
on
Google
Drive
so
you
can
create
those
groups
easily
You'll
be
just
writing
your
names
or
whatever
the
way
he
wanted
to
create
the
groups
And
you're
going
to
give
this
survey
Now
listen
please
either
to
this
class
better
2111
simply
because
we
have
many
more
students
in
111
and
I'm
teaching
right
now
Can
ask
them
to
fill
Yeah
Now
I
I'm
also
teaching
141
If
there
is
something
that
you
want
to
compare
I
can
ask
those
students
to
fill
out
the
survey
as
well
So
these
are
the
students
that
can't
take
but
kinda
disturbing
if
you
have
a
way
to
give
it
to
someone
else
where
you
would
have
at
least
40-50
atleast
40-50
responders
then
we
can
talk
and
you
probably
can
do
it
It
depends
on
These
people
are
going
to
be
Now
what
I
would
like
you
to
do
is
to
create
a
meaningful
survey
This
survey
is
going
to
be
graded
This
survey
is
going
to
be
a
part
of
one
of
your
labs
You're
going
to
create
You're
going
to
collect
the
data
you're
going
to
clean
it
Instead
of
putting
it
towards
your
final
projects
We're
going
to
do
it
right
now
so
you
won't
deal
with
it
at
the
end
of
the
quarter
So
this
is
just
a
way
to
redistribute
your
work
Looking
at
the
last
quarter
it
may
be
a
little
more
convenient
for
you
Then
when
you
finalize
your
project
and
when
you
get
your
data
later
on
you
may
need
cleaning
but
you're
not
going
to
do
anything
that
I
would
require
you
to
do
You
just
do
whatever
is
needed
for
your
particular
project
which
at
that
point
is
going
to
be
straightforward
for
you
Now
what
you
want
to
do
right
now
is
to
think
of
what
kinds
of
questions
you
want
to
ask
Now
I
would
like
you
right
now
to
tell
me
what
types
of
questions
aren't
good
Or
just
give
me
some
examples
of
questions
that
you
think
no
this
is
not
good
Now
what
kind
of
if
you
are
given
multiple
choice
what
kind
of
answers
are
not
going
to
work
Give
me
some
examples
right
now
please
An
example
of
a
question
that
is
not
going
to
work
and
divide
I
you
see
a
student
ask
111
students
if
they
see
a
student's
Well
you
may
be
surprised
The
rescuers
from
statistics
sometimes
biology
sometimes
a
lot
of
my
students
So
that's
a
normal
question
That's
ok
Well
if
you
ask
if
they're
English
majors
probably
But
it's
not
a
bad
question
Maybe
it's
just
not
going
to
be
useful
because
it's
easy
to
answer
No
I'm
not
right
And
so
does
the
word
green
start
with
G
Useless
question
Yeah
these
are
useless
questions
It's
not
that
they're
bad
questions
that
interest
useless
that
you
write
So
what
question
That
sometimes
you
see
in
surveys
I'm
not
I'm
not
asking
you
to
make
up
useless
questions
Sometimes
you
see
these
types
of
questions
in
service
I
think
about
it
You've
taken
a
number
of
surveys
before
right
And
then
you
have
written
this
question
and
you
think
to
yourself
what
do
they
mean
by
it
So
if
you
can't
make
sense
if
you
don't
understand
what
they
mean
If
you
don't
understand
what
they're
asking
about
exactly
sometimes
the
question
may
have
two
parts
and
only
one
choice
to
answer
Do
you
like
this
or
that
For
example
No
matter
but
wait
to
ask
Do
you
like
AM
classes
or
or
you're
like
more
technical
classes
Okay
Would
you
like
some
fish
or
go
for
a
walk
Something
like
that
So
if
the
question
has
two
parts
the
answer
must
have
all
those
parts
of
combinations
that
a
person
who's
taken
disturbing
me
insert
used
Focus
direct
questions
exactly
In
order
to
collect
the
data
you
can
use
and
cleaned
rather
than
vague
questions
is
they
lead
into
vague
answers
Very
good
Do
you
have
experienced
coding
Human
This
is
a
bad
question
Again
this
is
one
of
those
questions
that
is
probably
if
you
don't
know
Remember
what
I
started
with
If
we
wanted
to
conduct
to
some
if
we
wanted
to
collect
some
data
in
biology
or
chemistry
for
example
I'm
not
going
to
do
it
because
I
have
no
clue
what
to
do
how
to
do
what
to
ask
and
how
to
conduct
the
experiment
Now
if
you're
asking
questions
to
111
students
that
you
should
know
that
they've
taken
CS
classes
right
You
need
to
know
the
participants
and
their
big
ground
at
least
to
some
degree
By
when
should
we
have
the
survey
ready
again
Again
Or
you
want
me
to
repeat
There
is
no
deadline
just
yet
We
just
started
and
I
want
you
to
start
thinking
I
want
you
I
will
ask
you
to
create
groups
and
come
up
with
some
questions
On
Monday
you'll
start
thinking
about
it
And
then
I
would
say
maybe
by
Wednesday
you
should
have
it
Maybe
But
I
would
like
to
talk
to
you
on
Monday
and
see
if
you
have
your
questions
And
then
he
will
start
combining
Your
groups
are
combined
If
multiple
groups
want
to
If
multiple
groups
wanted
to
give
this
questions
2111
then
you
need
to
collaborate
I
I
don't
know
if
SRE
if
you
would
be
willing
to
be
ahead
of
process
because
you
take
an
111
last
time
last
quarter
I
had
also
student
that
was
taken
one
of
5111
be
in
charge
of
the
process
to
get
places
No
I
just
send
everyone's
surveys
and
the
CS101
and
link
group
turn
We
will
talk
about
it
later
We
will
talk
about
it
If
you
agree
then
it
will
be
easier
for
me
to
communicate
just
with
you
than
with
all
the
groups
that
are
not
insisting
You
will
just
kick
other
groups
and
make
sure
that
they're
done
where
a
particular
day
Okay
Thank
you
Appreciate
it
Is
it
possible
that
someone
is
taken

with
me
right
now
Do
the
group
members
have
to
be
in
the
same
lab
session
though
if
you
can
can
communicate
over
email
Slack
that's
fine
with
me
You
don't
need
to
do
during
the
lab
session
if
it
is
convenient
for
you
to
communicate
Right
Because
during
the
lobby
can
be
put
into
the
breakout
rooms
and
it
is
very
convenient
to
do
during
the
law
Well
you
can
just
ask
your
group
members
to
join
the
team
That's
fine
Do
you
have
any
questions
You
ask
me
to
post
the
recording
And
I
did
I
think
on
Wednesday
and
to
remember
or
