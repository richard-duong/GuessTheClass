00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,680
hi everybody this is keys indoors

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,600
video number four this tutorial is about

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,199
implementing inventory mechanics into

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,199
your maze prototype

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,400
it will introduce us to the hud and a

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,640
process of manipulating basic objects

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,400
we will use a key to open a door but

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
remember a key could be anything

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
a ham sandwich a shotgun or a memory and

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
so could a door

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,160
a hungry dog a jealous lover or a

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,079
fragile psyche

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,600
the first magic trick is this we need an

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
object in the game world we're going to

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,800
see an object in the game world

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,360
and we're going to move towards it and

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,160
when we get close enough it will vanish

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,559
and then when we press a when we it will

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,280
save the idea that we are carrying it

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,800
and when we press a key and i we can

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,559
show an inventory that shows that we

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
have it

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,399
the second magic trick is that when the

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,400
player comes upon a door

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,519
and is carrying the key the door opens

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,960
automatically

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,520
and if they're not carrying the key they

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,840
get a message so for starters

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
let's prepare some fonts for messages

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,479
and some graphics for

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,479
our objects so we're going to import a

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,520
font

33
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,080
so you can make your own font i am today

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,759
i'm going to import a font from dafont

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,840
and we will use today we'll use the

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,280
first thing we see daily hours

37
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
and i'm going to save this file

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,479
so at this point

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,200
i want to go to my project folder

40
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,119
on my desktop that contains my adventure

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
i'm going to go into content

42
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,119
i'm going to create a directory called

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,280
fonts

44
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,840
if i don't have one created already and

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,840
i'm going to take that file

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,159
and we'll put it in the directory i will

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,159
right click and extract all

48
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,200
and we'll extract

49
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,160
and uh that's it for the internet for

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,360
now

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,840
uh it is daily hours so it's a ttf file

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,040
so now if we have opened our adventure

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
i'm keeping up

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,920
i'm keeping a shortcut on my desktop for

55
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,920
open our adventure

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,599
we'll see that if we placed it anywhere

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,360
in our content file

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
unreal engine already knows that it's a

59
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,920
kind of file type that it recognizes

60
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,800
so we're going to click to import and

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
click yes all

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,800
okay and

63
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
so we go if we go under content we see

64
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
under my fonts

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,760
the daily hours is here we can double

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,560
click on daily hours and have a look at

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
it

68
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,760
and down here down in the bottom here

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,159
that's the actual preview of the font

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
itself

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,040
okay so we can create increase that size

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
if we want to i'm going to go up to

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
under runtime font legacy font size

74
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,519
i'll go up to 20 we can see a little bit

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,720
better

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,720
and save and then minimize

77
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,920
okay so now if we want to test it out

78
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,440
i've created a folder under content for

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,920
widgets

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,720
so go under my widgets and

81
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,959
create a widget so right click under

82
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,599
user interface

83
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
widget blueprint and i'm going to call

84
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,720
this

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,080
widget test test

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
and it's going to be a widget that i'm

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
going to use to test

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,239
uh fonts and things like that okay

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,599
so here i'm going to put the text under

90
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,519
the palette

91
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
select the text object and place it on

92
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,799
the canvas panel

93
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,879
so it becomes a job of the canvas panel

94
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
select it you might have to move in a

95
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,360
little bit

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
and then move your text object

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,120
i'm going to move mine roughly to the

98
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,639
center of the screen

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,639
and i'll change this to

100
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,240
i'll keep that the same

101
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:35,199
so now we want to apply our font to it

102
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,160
so i'm going under under appearance

103
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
font where it says roboto let's go under

104
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,800
here

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,560
and let's select the font that we that

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
we added

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,479
and now scroll in and we can see that

108
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,600
our font works

109
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,080
i'm going to increase the size here

110
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
and you'll notice under under this

111
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,960
appearance

112
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,759
there's a few things that you might want

113
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,960
to take note of color and opacity

114
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,440
so i'm going to select a color let's uh

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,440
i'm going to create a color

116
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,560
let's go in the purple area

117
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
now when you're creating a color design

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,199
for prototype it might it's

119
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,960
sometimes nice to um have a kind of

120
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
repertoire of colors so i'm going to

121
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
take that swatch i'm going to put it up

122
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
there so now it's

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,400
now it's there other times i want to use

124
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,320
that purple

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,320
maybe in other places maybe in objects

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,520
and things like that

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
good and i'll click ok

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
and other things we want to have a look

129
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
at

130
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,400
let's go move change the justification

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
to center

132
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,479
and i'm going to scroll down a little

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
bit we'll have a look

134
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,319
this flower in the upper left hand

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,840
corner that's the anchor

136
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,039
so this will this will be a reference

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,240
for the playback screen

138
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,199
and it's important because sometimes you

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
will

140
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
not see things in previewing because

141
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
they're anchored in odd places

142
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,479
and you'll think you're doing something

143
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
with the widget but you just can't see

144
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,639
it when you're previewing

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,080
and the other situation that comes up is

146
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
if you have

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
a design that's going out to multiple

148
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,639
different platforms

149
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,919
like a mobile screen is different than a

150
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,919
computer screen and so you might have

151
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,600
objects anchored to the side an

152
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,720
inventory anchored to the side for

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,039
example

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
and it doesn't show up because it's

155
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,280
anchored to the wrong size for the

156
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,840
mobile

157
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:48,720
that sort of thing so compile

158
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,560
and save and so now we have a widget we

159
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,360
can test

160
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,840
so i'm going to test this widget i'm

161
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,000
going to open the level blueprint

162
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:05,599
i'm going to right click keyboard

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,840
and i would like to do test it with a

164
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:13,120
t for test so keyboard c

165
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,759
to test the widget when it's pressed

166
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,560
i want to create a widget

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,520
the widget class that i want to create

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
is the test

169
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,560
that we just created

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,240
i'm going to drag out of the return

171
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,440
value this is a little shortcut to add

172
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,039
it to the viewport

173
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,039
and click add to viewport here

174
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
and you see it automatically connects

175
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,680
both

176
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:50,240
compile and save

177
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:55,280
and now when we play if we click

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,280
t it adds our block to the viewport

179
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
now the second thing that we want to be

180
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
able to do is we only want to be able to

181
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,919
use our font

182
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
for objects that are in the world not

183
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,639
just

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,919
on the view screen in front of us not

185
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,560
just on the hud

186
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:17,039
so i'm going to add a text object text

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:20,080
render object excuse me to the world

188
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:25,680
and you can see that this

189
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:30,960
object has text on it if i select it

190
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,960
character oops i select the character

191
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
where are you

192
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,880
we should be able to see the text i'm

193
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,560
going to move a little bit so that we're

194
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,240
right in front of it

195
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,240
yeah it's a little dim isn't it

196
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,399
and i will turn it around it should just

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:09:09,839
look backwards it's fine

198
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:09,839
but i will rotate it

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,600
and it's just not very bright there it

200
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,040
is down there

201
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,040
i'm going to bring it up a little bit

202
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,959
and i'm going to make it larger than

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,959
this larger text

204
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
so we'll go texture under color let's

205
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,440
give it

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,839
purple like we had before and now

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,800
let's create go to world size and make

208
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,800
it a little bit larger

209
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,160
okay and save

210
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
so now we can see it

211
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,800
let me play a little bit easier okay

212
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,800
so now if we want to change that to our

213
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,079
new font

214
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,560
we go to here and if we

215
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,079
uh put there ours was called daily hours

216
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,839
we put it there we noticed that there's

217
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,920
nothing there

218
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,160
that's because unreal engine uses a

219
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,959
system called distance fields and this

220
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
economizes on computation during ray

221
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,680
tracing

222
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,000
and provides a lot of other benefits

223
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,600
in terms of reduction of data and since

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
we're creating a 3d object

225
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,360
and there's nothing to say that this 3d

226
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,120
object can't be a mile long

227
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,360
in unreal world it needs to have

228
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,360
the ability to do distance fields

229
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
so

230
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
uh let's go ahead and let's find the

231
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,360
font on the browser

232
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,320
and i'm going to go to my fonts daily

233
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
hours

234
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,160
there's the daily hours font i'm going

235
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
to duplicate

236
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,399
it so i'm going to have two versions of

237
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
this font one for widgets and one for

238
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,680
the world

239
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,079
and i'm going to use the word distance

240
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
field

241
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,760
just like the system does

242
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
so that i can search for it

243
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,560
easily in any of the in any list that

244
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,240
comes up

245
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,360
okay so now let's open it up and

246
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,920
the first thing we need to do is to

247
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
try to

248
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,760
open uh make it a a

249
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,560
distance field font we need to go

250
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,079
offline to do it okay

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
changing the case type will cause this

252
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
font to reinitialize that's what we're

253
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,720
doing we're going to this kind of older

254
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,079
form of

255
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,240
representation here and let's go and

256
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,839
let's find

257
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
our font was called

258
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,560
daily hours now watch this is going to

259
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,560
fail

260
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,920
so we're looking for daily hours you'll

261
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,720
see it

262
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,279
now let's search explicitly for it daily

263
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
hours

264
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,000
daily hours

265
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,839
okay and we see that it's not there so

266
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,040
this is by

267
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,200
this is because uh trying to go offline

268
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,040
we're not able to use the font that we

269
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,079
imported

270
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
so what we need to do is we need to take

271
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,399
this font

272
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,760
and we need to install it in in the

273
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,680
operating system

274
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
so i'm going down it's on the different

275
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
screen but i'm telling you what i'm

276
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,440
doing

277
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
i'm in the lower left hand of the screen

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,240
in the search bar

279
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,240
and i'm typing font settings

280
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,320
so now this will bring up our font

281
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,360
settings

282
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,519
and i'm copying that

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,519
and we can see down here the daily hours

284
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,200
is now installed

285
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,880
so now i'm going to go back to unreal

286
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,959
engine

287
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,240
and go to our distance field font

288
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:21,839
click offline click yes

289
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,839
and now look for daily hours

290
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,519
and there it is daily hours i'm going to

291
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,240
make it a little bit bigger

292
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,079
and bring it in and there's our font

293
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,120
daily hours

294
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,680
so now that we have access to it

295
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,959
in offline we're going to re-import it

296
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
but we're going to re-import it with the

297
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,760
distance field

298
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,760
so let's go down to

299
00:13:51,839 --> 00:14:01,279
offline font import options

300
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:04,880
use distance field alpha check that

301
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,320
okay and now we are going to go under

302
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,120
asset and we are going to reimport daily

303
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,360
hours font distance field

304
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
and now it has generated a version that

305
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
we can use in space

306
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,560
so let's save

307
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,680
and close that

308
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
and now we'll go back to our make sure

309
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,760
our text render object system

310
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,560
is selected excuse me and

311
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,720
under font for the text render object

312
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,160
let's use our distance field version

313
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
and there it is it pops right in

314
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,519
save and we will play that's what it

315
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,440
looks like

316
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,040
so we've now customized our font we have

317
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,480
a font that we can use

318
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,360
that will make our game look a little

319
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
bit special to us

320
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
okay and then the next thing we're going

321
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,920
to do for setup

322
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
is we are going to scan and prep our

323
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
graphics

324
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,320
so i'm going to go out of unreal engine

325
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:13,040
and i'm going to go into the

326
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:16,639
at this point

327
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,240
and i'm going to bring in

328
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,519
a graphic that i have created that has

329
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,800
some inventory objects

330
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,720
that i want to play with so

331
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:32,079
i put it into the project

332
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,720
your content and i have a my scans

333
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,720
directory

334
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:42,800
and this is what this looks like

335
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,720
excuse me so these are black and white

336
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,680
black and white pictures i made for some

337
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
things that i might

338
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,440
want to use so we're going to have a key

339
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
to open a door today

340
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
uh here's a sandwich for a dog here's a

341
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
letter i don't know what the letter is

342
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
for yet but this is just to this is

343
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,320
we're just

344
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
making a prototype so we're just using

345
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,399
this to learn

346
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
how to make a more complicated inventory

347
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,639
and

348
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,320
i'm going to have have you meet a

349
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,920
character i think

350
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,279
so i've drawn pictures prototype

351
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,720
pictures for these things so that we'll

352
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,240
have something to put in our digital

353
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
version of our game

354
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,440
and so let's go ahead and i'm going to

355
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,560
take that skin and i'm going to drag it

356
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,240
right in

357
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,680
drag it right into all right so i'm

358
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
not going to change the size of these

359
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
things

360
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
i'm going to scale them in unreal engine

361
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,320
but i am going to

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,920
[Music]

363
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,360
break them apart and add an alpha

364
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,959
channel so

365
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,399
we see that with our entire scan

366
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,519
selected i'm going to make sure that

367
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,639
it's everything is

368
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,199
selected with ctrl a under colors

369
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,040
i'm going to click color to alpha and it

370
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,480
has correctly guessed that i want to

371
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,519
remove the white so i'm going to click

372
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,360
ok now i am going to start

373
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
breaking this apart into individual

374
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,079
graphics here's a key

375
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,040
i'm going to go ahead and select the

376
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,079
rectangular select tool

377
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,199
and copy

378
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,600
and ctrl v to paste floating selection

379
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,799
is here i'm going to call this key

380
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:10,240
and enter so now

381
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:12,000
i have this key on its own layer

382
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
so let's do that for each of our other

383
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
objects

384
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
sandwich

385
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:33,840
and i'll call this a letter

386
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,840
okay uh you see what happened is that i

387
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,600
had the wrong thing selected i didn't

388
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
even though i saw it on the screen

389
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,400
i didn't have the correct i didn't have

390
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,480
the correct thing selected so we

391
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,320
accidentally pasted the sandwich

392
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,440
again so now with the scan selected i

393
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
want to select the letter

394
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,960
i'm going to remove this layer right

395
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
click

396
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,440
delete layer so now with the scan

397
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,440
selected i do the select

398
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,880
copy v

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,960
lighter goes return and that's all that

400
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,000
we need to get today

401
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,760
so i'm going to close that

402
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,280
and let's export these as graphics i'm

403
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
going to go to the key

404
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:30,160
make sure that layer is selected i'd

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,240
like to rotate this a little bit

406
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
so i'm going to go under the uniform

407
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,720
transform

408
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,039
and if i transform right click rotate

409
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,120
i rotate my key a little bit so because

410
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,840
when i see it on the screen

411
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,840
i want to

412
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,760
go ahead and click rotate and i'm going

413
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,240
to do the same thing for the sandwich

414
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,080
i'm going to select the sandwich layer

415
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,440
the unified transform we're on the

416
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
rotate tool because we've already

417
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,919
selected

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,760
it and i'm going to rotate that sandwich

419
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,559
and rotate and now the same thing for

420
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,880
this letter

421
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,240
i'm going to click the letter we have

422
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,840
the tool ready

423
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
and rotate the letter

424
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
these are very best pictionary skills to

425
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,520
select these things

426
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,080
okay the key is now selected i'm going

427
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,880
to

428
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,799
kind of approximate a square selection

429
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,880
here because this is going to be

430
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,080
the proportions of the tile we'll use so

431
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,840
with that selected

432
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
i'm going to go under layer i'm going to

433
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,720
go under image excuse me

434
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,799
and fit canvas to selection and so now

435
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:52,160
we have a roughly square

436
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:57,360
thing that we can use i think maybe

437
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,360
i think maybe make it exactly square

438
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,559
just so we know and now image

439
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,080
good canvas to selection much better i'm

440
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,880
going to move the key i'm going to

441
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,280
select

442
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,159
but with the move tool i'm going to move

443
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,159
the key a little bit

444
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,240
all right so now the key is going to be

445
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,720
transparent

446
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,480
uh in the background but it'll be much

447
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,960
easier to see if we fill it in with some

448
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,919
kind of

449
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,960
some kind of coloring so i let's i'm

450
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,080
going to use white

451
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,919
for today so it looks more prototypey

452
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,320
and i'm going to select the bucket tool

453
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
if you don't see some of the tools that

454
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,679
i'm finding

455
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,919
go under under tools and make sure that

456
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,159
the tools that you want are there or you

457
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
can even just open them from there

458
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,440
okay so i'm going to take this bucket

459
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,159
tool so it'll take this color

460
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,960
it will fill in that key there we go

461
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,840
there's a nice textured looking thing

462
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,200
that we got by me using the eraser too

463
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,320
soon and smearing the

464
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,039
and smearing the ink i'm going to save

465
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,400
this project so we're not saving the

466
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,360
graphic here we're just saving the

467
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
project

468
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,320
and i'm going to save this in

469
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,760
in the same folder the same unreal

470
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,960
engine folder

471
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,919
an xcf file is a is a file

472
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,679
and i unreal engine just won't see it

473
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,640
but we can still have it as part of our

474
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,760
project

475
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:28,000
so i'm going to call this inventory

476
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,679
items and click save

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
okay and so now i'm going to start

478
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,120
exporting graphics so i'm going to

479
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,919
under file export as

480
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,640
i'm going to put this in content under

481
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,640
my objects

482
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,280
and uh these are old versions of

483
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,520
doing this exercise so i'm going to call

484
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
this

485
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,440
excuse me

486
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,840
inventory one

487
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,520
key

488
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,000
export and using the png file

489
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,480
rather than jpeg or gif that will

490
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
make sure that we have that transparency

491
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,520
ready for us

492
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,280
and let's just double check in unreal

493
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,200
engine that it's done what we want

494
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,840
so i just clicked over to unreal engine

495
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:33,120
i'm going to go ahead and click import

496
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,679
and now under content by objects

497
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
inventory in key that's the one we're

498
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,000
using

499
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,159
that's the one i use just for

500
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,760
demonstration invo1

501
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,760
key and we can if we double click we can

502
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,740
[Music]

503
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
open

504
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
you
