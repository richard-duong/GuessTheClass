hi everybody this is keys indoors


video number four this tutorial is about


implementing inventory mechanics into


your maze prototype


it will introduce us to the hud and a


process of manipulating basic objects


we will use a key to open a door but


remember a key could be anything


a ham sandwich a shotgun or a memory and


so could a door


a hungry dog a jealous lover or a


fragile psyche


the first magic trick is this we need an


object in the game world we're going to


see an object in the game world


and we're going to move towards it and


when we get close enough it will vanish


and then when we press a when we it will


save the idea that we are carrying it


and when we press a key and i we can


show an inventory that shows that we


have it


the second magic trick is that when the


player comes upon a door


and is carrying the key the door opens


automatically


and if they're not carrying the key they


get a message so for starters


let's prepare some fonts for messages


and some graphics for


our objects so we're going to import a


font


so you can make your own font i am today


i'm going to import a font from dafont


and we will use today we'll use the


first thing we see daily hours


and i'm going to save this file


so at this point


i want to go to my project folder


on my desktop that contains my adventure


i'm going to go into content


i'm going to create a directory called


fonts


if i don't have one created already and


i'm going to take that file


and we'll put it in the directory i will


right click and extract all


and we'll extract


and uh that's it for the internet for


now


uh it is daily hours so it's a ttf file


so now if we have opened our adventure


i'm keeping up


i'm keeping a shortcut on my desktop for


open our adventure


we'll see that if we placed it anywhere


in our content file


unreal engine already knows that it's a


kind of file type that it recognizes


so we're going to click to import and


click yes all


okay and


so we go if we go under content we see


under my fonts


the daily hours is here we can double


click on daily hours and have a look at


it


and down here down in the bottom here


that's the actual preview of the font


itself


okay so we can create increase that size


if we want to i'm going to go up to


under runtime font legacy font size


i'll go up to 20 we can see a little bit


better


and save and then minimize


okay so now if we want to test it out


i've created a folder under content for


widgets


so go under my widgets and


create a widget so right click under


user interface


widget blueprint and i'm going to call


this


widget test test


and it's going to be a widget that i'm


going to use to test


uh fonts and things like that okay


so here i'm going to put the text under


the palette


select the text object and place it on


the canvas panel


so it becomes a job of the canvas panel


select it you might have to move in a


little bit


and then move your text object


i'm going to move mine roughly to the


center of the screen


and i'll change this to


i'll keep that the same


so now we want to apply our font to it


so i'm going under under appearance


font where it says roboto let's go under


here


and let's select the font that we that


we added


and now scroll in and we can see that


our font works


i'm going to increase the size here


and you'll notice under under this


appearance


there's a few things that you might want


to take note of color and opacity


so i'm going to select a color let's uh


i'm going to create a color


let's go in the purple area


now when you're creating a color design


for prototype it might it's


sometimes nice to um have a kind of


repertoire of colors so i'm going to


take that swatch i'm going to put it up


there so now it's


now it's there other times i want to use


that purple


maybe in other places maybe in objects


and things like that


good and i'll click ok


and other things we want to have a look


at


let's go move change the justification


to center


and i'm going to scroll down a little


bit we'll have a look


this flower in the upper left hand


corner that's the anchor


so this will this will be a reference


for the playback screen


and it's important because sometimes you


will


not see things in previewing because


they're anchored in odd places


and you'll think you're doing something


with the widget but you just can't see


it when you're previewing


and the other situation that comes up is


if you have


a design that's going out to multiple


different platforms


like a mobile screen is different than a


computer screen and so you might have


objects anchored to the side an


inventory anchored to the side for


example


and it doesn't show up because it's


anchored to the wrong size for the


mobile


that sort of thing so compile


and save and so now we have a widget we


can test


so i'm going to test this widget i'm


going to open the level blueprint


i'm going to right click keyboard


and i would like to do test it with a


t for test so keyboard c


to test the widget when it's pressed


i want to create a widget


the widget class that i want to create


is the test


that we just created


i'm going to drag out of the return


value this is a little shortcut to add


it to the viewport


and click add to viewport here


and you see it automatically connects


both


compile and save


and now when we play if we click


t it adds our block to the viewport


now the second thing that we want to be


able to do is we only want to be able to


use our font


for objects that are in the world not


just


on the view screen in front of us not


just on the hud


so i'm going to add a text object text


render object excuse me to the world


and you can see that this


object has text on it if i select it


character oops i select the character


where are you


we should be able to see the text i'm


going to move a little bit so that we're


right in front of it


yeah it's a little dim isn't it


and i will turn it around it should just


look backwards it's fine


but i will rotate it


and it's just not very bright there it


is down there


i'm going to bring it up a little bit


and i'm going to make it larger than


this larger text


so we'll go texture under color let's


give it


purple like we had before and now


let's create go to world size and make


it a little bit larger


okay and save


so now we can see it


let me play a little bit easier okay


so now if we want to change that to our


new font


we go to here and if we


uh put there ours was called daily hours


we put it there we noticed that there's


nothing there


that's because unreal engine uses a


system called distance fields and this


economizes on computation during ray


tracing


and provides a lot of other benefits


in terms of reduction of data and since


we're creating a 3d object


and there's nothing to say that this 3d


object can't be a mile long


in unreal world it needs to have


the ability to do distance fields


so


uh let's go ahead and let's find the


font on the browser


and i'm going to go to my fonts daily


hours


there's the daily hours font i'm going


to duplicate


it so i'm going to have two versions of


this font one for widgets and one for


the world


and i'm going to use the word distance


field


just like the system does


so that i can search for it


easily in any of the in any list that


comes up


okay so now let's open it up and


the first thing we need to do is to


try to


open uh make it a a


distance field font we need to go


offline to do it okay


changing the case type will cause this


font to reinitialize that's what we're


doing we're going to this kind of older


form of


representation here and let's go and


let's find


our font was called


daily hours now watch this is going to


fail


so we're looking for daily hours you'll


see it


now let's search explicitly for it daily


hours


daily hours


okay and we see that it's not there so


this is by


this is because uh trying to go offline


we're not able to use the font that we


imported


so what we need to do is we need to take


this font


and we need to install it in in the


operating system


so i'm going down it's on the different


screen but i'm telling you what i'm


doing


i'm in the lower left hand of the screen


in the search bar


and i'm typing font settings


so now this will bring up our font


settings


and i'm copying that


and we can see down here the daily hours


is now installed


so now i'm going to go back to unreal


engine


and go to our distance field font


click offline click yes


and now look for daily hours


and there it is daily hours i'm going to


make it a little bit bigger


and bring it in and there's our font


daily hours


so now that we have access to it


in offline we're going to re-import it


but we're going to re-import it with the


distance field


so let's go down to


offline font import options


use distance field alpha check that


okay and now we are going to go under


asset and we are going to reimport daily


hours font distance field


and now it has generated a version that


we can use in space


so let's save


and close that


and now we'll go back to our make sure


our text render object system


is selected excuse me and


under font for the text render object


let's use our distance field version


and there it is it pops right in


save and we will play that's what it


looks like


so we've now customized our font we have


a font that we can use


that will make our game look a little


bit special to us


okay and then the next thing we're going


to do for setup


is we are going to scan and prep our


graphics


so i'm going to go out of unreal engine


and i'm going to go into the


at this point


and i'm going to bring in


a graphic that i have created that has


some inventory objects


that i want to play with so


i put it into the project


your content and i have a my scans


directory


and this is what this looks like


excuse me so these are black and white


black and white pictures i made for some


things that i might


want to use so we're going to have a key


to open a door today


uh here's a sandwich for a dog here's a


letter i don't know what the letter is


for yet but this is just to this is


we're just


making a prototype so we're just using


this to learn


how to make a more complicated inventory


and


i'm going to have have you meet a


character i think


so i've drawn pictures prototype


pictures for these things so that we'll


have something to put in our digital


version of our game


and so let's go ahead and i'm going to


take that skin and i'm going to drag it


right in


drag it right into all right so i'm


not going to change the size of these


things


i'm going to scale them in unreal engine


but i am going to


[music]


break them apart and add an alpha


channel so


we see that with our entire scan


selected i'm going to make sure that


it's everything is


selected with ctrl a under colors


i'm going to click color to alpha and it


has correctly guessed that i want to


remove the white so i'm going to click


ok now i am going to start


breaking this apart into individual


graphics here's a key


i'm going to go ahead and select the


rectangular select tool


and copy


and ctrl v to paste floating selection


is here i'm going to call this key


and enter so now


i have this key on its own layer


so let's do that for each of our other


objects


sandwich


and i'll call this a letter


okay uh you see what happened is that i


had the wrong thing selected i didn't


even though i saw it on the screen


i didn't have the correct i didn't have


the correct thing selected so we


accidentally pasted the sandwich


again so now with the scan selected i


want to select the letter


i'm going to remove this layer right


click


delete layer so now with the scan


selected i do the select


copy v


lighter goes return and that's all that


we need to get today


so i'm going to close that


and let's export these as graphics i'm


going to go to the key


make sure that layer is selected i'd


like to rotate this a little bit


so i'm going to go under the uniform


transform


and if i transform right click rotate


i rotate my key a little bit so because


when i see it on the screen


i want to


go ahead and click rotate and i'm going


to do the same thing for the sandwich


i'm going to select the sandwich layer


the unified transform we're on the


rotate tool because we've already


selected


it and i'm going to rotate that sandwich


and rotate and now the same thing for


this letter


i'm going to click the letter we have


the tool ready


and rotate the letter


these are very best pictionary skills to


select these things


okay the key is now selected i'm going


to


kind of approximate a square selection


here because this is going to be


the proportions of the tile we'll use so


with that selected


i'm going to go under layer i'm going to


go under image excuse me


and fit canvas to selection and so now


we have a roughly square


thing that we can use i think maybe


i think maybe make it exactly square


just so we know and now image


good canvas to selection much better i'm


going to move the key i'm going to


select


but with the move tool i'm going to move


the key a little bit


all right so now the key is going to be


transparent


uh in the background but it'll be much


easier to see if we fill it in with some


kind of


some kind of coloring so i let's i'm


going to use white


for today so it looks more prototypey


and i'm going to select the bucket tool


if you don't see some of the tools that


i'm finding


go under under tools and make sure that


the tools that you want are there or you


can even just open them from there


okay so i'm going to take this bucket


tool so it'll take this color


it will fill in that key there we go


there's a nice textured looking thing


that we got by me using the eraser too


soon and smearing the


and smearing the ink i'm going to save


this project so we're not saving the


graphic here we're just saving the


project


and i'm going to save this in


in the same folder the same unreal


engine folder


an xcf file is a is a file


and i unreal engine just won't see it


but we can still have it as part of our


project


so i'm going to call this inventory


items and click save


okay and so now i'm going to start


exporting graphics so i'm going to


under file export as


i'm going to put this in content under


my objects


and uh these are old versions of


doing this exercise so i'm going to call


this


excuse me


inventory one


key


export and using the png file


rather than jpeg or gif that will


make sure that we have that transparency


ready for us


and let's just double check in unreal


engine that it's done what we want


so i just clicked over to unreal engine


i'm going to go ahead and click import


and now under content by objects


inventory in key that's the one we're


using


that's the one i use just for


demonstration invo

key and we can if we double click we can


[music]


open


you
