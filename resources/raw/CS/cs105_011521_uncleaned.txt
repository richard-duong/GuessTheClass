To record probability for data science,

00:00

It certainly is not going to be a course on probability.

00:04

I'm not going to compete with CS

00:08

155 even this is a course in

00:12

statistics that covers probability as well.

00:15

We are going, we're only going to have one class on.

00:18

It may be a little bit more,

00:23

up to two at most.

00:24

So I'm going to give you just some.

00:27

And that will be enough for our purposes.

00:30

We're going to start with independent events.

00:37

In probability, two events are independent if

00:45

the occurrence of one event

00:51

doesn't effect the outcome of the other.

00:54

So their probabilities are independent.

00:59

The doc can jump as many times as he wants and

01:04

the coin is going to be flipped right here.

01:08

When may have heads or tails,

01:12

but it doesn't depend on UDL and vice versa.

01:14

And the order doesn't matter either.

01:18

Well, unless he decides to eat it.

01:21

P of a and B,

01:25

the probability of a and B if the events are independent.

01:28

Only if the events are independent.

01:34

If the probability of a times the probability of B,

01:37

only if the events are independent.

01:42

Dependent events.

01:46

Two events are dependent when the outcome of

01:49

the first influences the outcome of the second,

01:54

or the outcome of one

01:59

influences the outcome of the other one.

02:02

The probability of a and B,

02:04

the advance or dependent,

02:08

is the probability of a.

02:11

If we're talking about a happen first event,

02:13

a happens first times the probability B of a.

02:16

In this case is just times the probability of

02:24

B because the event B doesn't depend on event.

02:28

So it's probability doesn't depend on the probability of,

02:32

if they are dependent,

02:36

then it's the probability of a.

02:38

And then may cause some different outcome in B.

02:41

So we must account for it times the probability

02:47

of B given that a

02:51

already occurred and we know the outcome of a.

02:53

Next mutually exclusive.

02:58

Inclusive events.

03:02

Exclusive, mutually exclusive events are

03:05

events that cannot happen at the same time.

03:09

They cannot, they don't happen at the same time.

03:15

In this case, the probability

03:18

of a or B is equal to the probability of

03:21

a plus the probability of

03:25

v. And this is the time what I would like to ask you.

03:27

Can you please give me

03:33

some examples of mutually exclusive events?

03:35

Mutually exclusive events.

03:39

Join a black sock or white sock from a drone.

03:56

Daytime or nighttime?

04:02

Well, daytime or nighttime.

04:05

But this is not an event.

04:07

Somehow maybe rephrase.

04:09

It.

04:13

Bought the sachs.

04:15

Well, it's not so clear.

04:17

I mean, the condition itself,

04:24

flipping a coin and getting heads or tails,

04:27

will it's not a mutually exclusive event.

04:33

Or maybe I just misunderstood what you were saying.

04:41

Okay, we will look at some examples later on.

04:55

A bit point, I would like you to point out,

04:59

these events are mutually

05:03

exclusive and these events are not.

05:05

These events are inclusive.

05:10

Alright.

05:13

The outcome of the coin, you know, they both, yep.

05:14

Okay.

05:17

Inclusive events or events that can

05:19

happen at the same time.

05:21

If you remember, 111,

05:24

we worked a lot on this, right?

05:26

If they advanced can't happen at the same time,

05:28

then the probability of a or B is equal to

05:32

the probability of a plus

05:37

the probability of B minus the intersection.

05:39

Remember, inclusion-exclusion principle.

05:44

If we take the cardinality of this,

05:49

the cardinality of that,

05:52

then the intersection can become,

05:54

will be counted twice.

05:58

And in order to know the cardinality of the union,

06:00

we need to subtract this intersection,

06:05

the cardinality of this intersection,

06:09

in which case we're going to get the correct number.

06:13

So these events are not

06:17

mutually exclusive, they aren't inclusive.

06:20

And you cannot compute the cardinality

06:24

by just adding the cardinality of each.

06:28

He can not compute the probability of.

06:30

The event a or event B.

06:34

By Ed in the probability of a and probability of B,

06:37

you have to subtract the intersection.

06:42

We will look at all of these examples later.

06:45

Interest a couple of minutes.

06:49

All right.

07:00

Here is an example.

07:02

Five age bill subscribers were

07:07

asked what they would

07:11

prefer watching the Game of Thrones.

07:14

World or something else.

07:17

Were the word right here,

07:23

213 male subscribers, they answered the Game of Thrones.

07:27

18, would prefer westward world,

07:33

one hundred and five hundred and footage female.

07:37

We want to analyze this data.

07:41

Anyway, we want right now.

07:45

So first question.

07:48

First question.

07:51

Can we somehow look the probability of

07:53

being of a particular gender and choosing a particular.

07:58

First.

08:07

Let's add the number of

08:08

people that chose Game of Thrones.

08:11

The second show and all the other shows,

08:15

we will add the number of male and female subscribers.

08:18

That's the data that we have.

08:24

So we have 500 total.

08:26

Now, it is very easy to see that first.

08:29

First.

08:37

If we want to compute,

08:39

you probably can't see them.

08:41

If we wanted to answer the question,

08:43

how many female prefer the Game of Thrones show?

08:46

You can look into the cell and you will see a

08:53

121% out of total.

08:56

It is a 120, is 0.240.24.

09:03

And I will do the same for each value.

09:08

I'll take each value and divide by 500.

09:12

It will give me

09:15

that person as opposed to give him, though that number.

09:16

What this value represents.

09:22

Each value tells us the number of, I mean,

09:26

the probability of being of a particular gender,

09:33

choosing a particular show,

09:38

or in this case, authorship.

09:41

And these numbers, these numbers tell me.

09:44

These numbers represent the probability

09:53

of choosing one of the shows.

09:57

Independently on the Chandra or right here,

10:03

being a male or a female.

10:08

As you can see,

10:12

these two add up to one.

10:15

These three add up to one.

10:18

What else is one?

10:21

What else is one here?

10:29

The sum of the proportions of females and males, right?

10:33

Right, is this sum.

10:38

Okay?

10:40

So what it is that we found each right here.

10:41

Each data point in a cell tells us the joint probability

10:49

of a particular gender

10:55

and choosing a particular show or other.

10:58

In this case, this is a joint probability.

11:02

That's the joint probability of all of those.

11:06

And if we'll look at all of them at the same time,

11:10

then we'll look at the joint probability distribution.

11:15

The joint probability distribution.

11:19

What is on this side and at the bottom,

11:28

these are marginal probability.

11:33

There's a marginal probability.

11:37

We are not looking at one of the variables,

11:39

will just analyze in another one.

11:43

Well, in this case there are only two.

11:46

So when analyzing this variable

11:48

independently on the gender,

11:52

this is what 0.4. represents

11:55

how many people chose Game of Thrones.

11:59

Now, again, this is the marginal probability.

12:04

And if I look at all three,

12:10

This is its distribution.

12:12

This are the marginal probabilities as well.

12:16

Each of them is a marginal probability.

12:20

And if I look at the two,

12:22

that's going to be a distribution.

12:23

Distribution.

12:27

Any questions?

12:30

Alright. Nokia? Yes, I understand.

12:40

I will ask you some questions.

12:46

And if you remember or better,

12:49

put the notes for yourself and

12:52

answer those questions clay

12:54

a little bit with probabilities.

12:55

We're not going to touch anything difficult to date.

12:57

I don't want to say that this is

13:01

all that you studied in your high school.

13:03

Probably not. But I'm trying to cover it

13:05

at a really low simple level.

13:09

So I don't want you to be overwhelmed.

13:13

You get 255 and you will get what else you need.

13:16

But this will be enough for now,

13:21

for now. For this class.

13:22

Also, you need to understand it really well.

13:24

Not a lot, but you have to understand

13:27

it well, okay. Alright.

13:29

Next.

13:32

The question here is,

13:34

what is the probability of an age bill subscriber

13:36

being male or preferring Westworld,

13:40

male or paternity preferring West work.

13:46

Alright, let's take 0.46.

13:52

That's the probability of being a male.

13:57

And let's take 0.25. and add

13:59

them because 0.25. is

14:04

the marginal probability of choosing Westworld.

14:06

Add them together.

14:10

This will get the answer correct.

14:12

You're double counting the 0.2 for Westworld mail.

14:17

Right?

14:22

So you can't just add both 0.25.46.

14:23

You have to add them

14:27

individually so you don't double count

14:29

the point to you can't add these two.

14:30

You have to add them individually.

14:36

If you just add the 0.460.25,

14:39

wouldn't you be counting 0.2 twice?

14:43

Okay. Yeah. I know that you were right at the first time.

14:48

I was just trying to make you

14:52

explain it a little bit better.

14:53

So what you're saying is if we add 0.06 and 0.25.

14:55

That means we counted 0.2 twice because it

15:02

is a part of being male

15:06

and it is a part of choosing westward.

15:08

This two events are what?

15:12

Inclusive?

15:19

They are inclusive exactly.

15:20

Well, they're not mutually exclusive.

15:23

In which case, you need to, if you want,

15:25

you can add 0.06 as 0.25,

15:29

but then you need to subtract the intersection.

15:33

Right? Or you can just go ahead and add one-by-one.

15:36

Now, question.

15:44

Question right now is

15:47

a way to check whether two events are

15:49

mutually exclusive for the joint distribution,

15:55

joint marginal distribution available

16:02

in this nice form.

16:15

So what is another way to

16:21

check its coming right from this?

16:23

Alright, I'll leave it as a question.

16:34

Alright, next, what is

16:41

the probability of an age bill subscriber

16:44

being a male or preferring Westworld being male.

16:48

And prefer westward.

16:55

What is it?

17:01

We just computed it.

17:08

We're looking at the formula, at the general formula.

17:15

So this won't be the 0.46 plus 0.25 minus 0.2, right?

17:24

So the probability of a or B is equal to

17:31

the probability of a plus the probability of

17:37

B minus the probability of their intersection.

17:40

Question. Can we use this formula?

17:45

If the events are mutually exclusive?

17:49

Yes, because the intersection would

17:53

be 0 if there were mutually exclusive?

17:56

Yes, the intersection would be

17:58

0 if they are mutually exclusive.

17:59

So this is the answer to your question.

18:01

Okay?

18:07

I'm still not stating it explicitly,

18:09

but you probably understand conditional probability.

18:12

Conditional probability is the probability that

18:19

an event will occur based on the condition.

18:23

But another event has occurred.

18:28

So one event has occurred.

18:34

We'll look at the next event.

18:38

But we already know that the first event has occurred.

18:41

And we can find out the outcome of that event.

18:46

That's the condition probability.

18:49

Does the conditional probability don't mix

18:52

the joint and conditional probabilities

18:56

in the joint probability.

18:58

The events are independent.

19:00

If the conditional probability, they are dependent.

19:03

The probability of B,

19:13

given that event a has occurred

19:18

is the probability of

19:22

a and B divided by the probability of gates.

19:26

Of course, we wanted to make sure before we

19:31

go and divide by the probability of a, of course,

19:33

we want to make sure that the probability of

19:36

non-zero is not 0.

19:39

The same example. We have

19:49

at joint probability right here.

19:54

And we have a marginal probability right there.

19:58

Question. Not a just God and age bill subscription.

20:02

What is the chance that

20:08

her favorite show will be Game of Thrones?

20:09

First question can be,

20:14

and the question that we asked before,

20:18

what is a probability of being

20:19

a female and choosing Game of Thrones?

20:22

In this question, right now, we have seen,

20:27

we know she is female.

20:31

Given that it is a female,

20:36

what's the probability that she chooses Game of Thrones?

20:39

Do you feel the difference between the two?

20:45

In the first, what's the probability of this and that?

20:48

That's the joint probability.

20:53

Here, conditional.

20:56

Our subscriber is a female.

20:58

I know that.

21:01

What's the probability that she chooses gain of from's.

21:02

So our event has occurred.

21:06

We wanted to see how it influences event.

21:11

So how do we compute it?

21:18

It's going to be the probability of a and b.

21:23

So this is our joint probability,

21:33

but it has to be divided by the probability of B.

21:36

Divided by the probability of B, which is 0.54.

21:42

This is our conditional probability.

21:48

Usually I see problems,

21:53

if anything, in probability than I see

21:59

some problems students have with conditional probability.

22:02

So this is the one that is a little bit

22:05

harder to understand me.

22:07

Professor. Any advice on how we

22:11

should pick the order when we're looking at

22:14

a question. Like what depends what?

22:16

Well, it's going to be coming from the question

22:19

from from the situation.

22:23

You see non interest,

22:28

God and age bill subscription,

22:30

she's over d. What

22:31

is the chance that

22:35

her favorite show will be Game of Thrones?

22:36

Now, you already know this is female, right?

22:40

So if you know that the subscriber is female,

22:47

what is the chance that

22:53

a particular show is going to be her favorite trope.

22:58

Now, this happened first.

23:03

Being female in this case happened first.

23:05

And this is a great question.

23:08

This is where you all remember this formula.

23:10

It's what to divide by what?

23:13

By, or rather divide by what,

23:14

what do we divide in?

23:17

But right now, I will show

23:18

the example where the roles or the situation is switched.

23:21

And he will see the difference here.

23:27

Let me click me see this one.

23:33

I can go back to this.

23:36

Given the better subscribers favorite show is Westworld.

23:38

What is the probability that their male?

23:42

Somebody said, my westward,

23:47

My favorite show is Westworld.

23:49

Who am I?

23:53

All right, what's the probability?

23:56

So in this case,

23:59

what we know is that the person chose Westworld.

24:00

Then this is what occurred first.

24:07

That already has occurred.

24:12

What do I do here?

24:18

I find the probability of a and b,

24:20

which is just our joint probability. That's easy.

24:24

And divided by the probability of

24:27

B and divide by the marginal probability.

24:30

And here we're just showing

24:40

the conditional probability distribution if we

24:44

answer this question three times.

24:46

So what is the probability of choosing Game of Thrones?

24:49

That, what's the probability of choosing

24:53

Westworld while being female?

24:55

What's the probability of choosing some other show?

24:57

That's that in each

25:00

of those cases where he's on this same formula,

25:03

but we're just changing the joint probability.

25:06

The joint probability changes.

25:12

The marginal probability stays.

25:15

We divide by this marginal probability every time.

25:18

Okay?

25:23

Alright.

25:31

Now again, another question

25:33

which relates to the previous question,

25:36

or not necessarily religious but

25:40

somewhat similar to a previous question.

25:42

Can we answer the question

25:45

whether the two events are independent?

25:48

By looking at some

25:53

of this data on conditional probability.

25:56

Do we know if the events are independent?

26:03

What would you say? Just by thinking?

26:10

The events are independent? If what?

26:14

So in this case they are dependent.

26:19

You can not make anything out of here.

26:21

But if they weren't dependent, what would happen?

26:23

One outcome does not affect the other outcome, right?

26:29

One outcome does not affect the other.

26:32

Being female doesn't affect Choosing westward.

26:35

That means if I compute

26:39

my conditional probability of choosing

26:41

Westworld under the condition of being male or female.

26:44

It must be equal to

26:50

the probability of choosing Westworld.

26:54

If they once weren't independent,

26:58

these two numbers would be the same.

27:01

Great. Ok. And one more example, right here.

27:06

Alex rolls a pair of dice.

27:16

What is the probability that both numbers are odd?

27:19

This sum is six.

27:24

Their sum is six,

27:28

so it is given, but their sum is six.

27:30

What's the probability that both numbers are odd?

27:33

In this case, what are you given?

27:40

What is the first event?

27:43

What is the condition?

27:48

In this case? The sum is six, right?

27:51

So you know that this sum is six.

28:00

You want to only find the probability of

28:05

both numbers being odd if their sum is six.

28:10

You don't care about

28:15

any other cases were numbers are odd.

28:17

For example, let's say 35.

28:21

You didn't care about this case

28:24

because there's some it's not six.

28:25

How can this question be answered?

28:28

Let's see. These are all possible outcomes.

28:32

In other words, this is the sample space.

28:36

The cases where both numbers are odd.

28:44

Cases where the sum of two numbers is six.

28:51

How many outcomes we have where

29:01

the were two numbers are odd and their sum is 6123.

29:07

How many pairs we have,

29:20

whose sum is 612345.

29:24

So after this gets easy,

29:30

one divided by the other.

29:32

But as you pointed out,

29:37

what's the most difficult is,

29:40

is to understand, is

29:41

this the case conditional probability?

29:43

Because sometimes for not

29:46

necessarily every time somebody's going to tell you,

29:49

find P of a,

29:53

given that B has occurred.

29:56

It may not be stated clearly,

30:02

even in this question,

30:05

probably at the beginning,

30:07

you were not sure whether

30:09

it is a conditional probability.

30:11

Which event occurred first,

30:13

which one would condition on, right?

30:16

We already talked about

30:29

it about the marginal distribution and

30:32

conditional or joint distribution

30:34

and conditional distribution.

30:35

I included several slides for permanently,

30:38

for those students that want little more math.

30:42

But I'm not going to go over in class.

30:45

If you want, you can look at it.

30:49

We can talk about it later.

30:50

But it is I don't know.

30:52

I doubt that it's going to be started in 155,

30:56

but certainly in red horse.

30:58

That is going to be the proper language.

31:01

So it's up to you.

31:05

Here's one example of that I included here as well.

31:10

It is for you.

31:15

And what do you think it's going to be?

31:21

That's going to be your in-class quiz, the quiz one.

31:31

And you need to complete it in

31:36

about eight minutes and been a great school.

31:39

And that's going to be your first great for quiz one.

31:41

A

31:48

reasonable

31:49

not

31:50

scope.

31:58

Well, that's a question You take it now.

32:01

Take a picture and submit a grade school.

32:04

There is an option.

32:09

Whichever one you prefer.

32:12

As an option, I can give you

32:14

this quiz to take

32:18

anytime you want and submit by Saturday night.

32:20

So what would you like?

32:24

It is submit in eight minutes or

32:27

by Saturday night, whichever you prefer.

32:30

Alden, I think I

32:33

was fine with me Saturday night.

32:38

One condition.

32:47

Well, 23 sterile conditions. First.

32:49

It's okay if you talk about it.

32:55

But I don't want you to copy obviously.

32:58

If anyone copies, I apologize.

33:01

That's going to be given it.

33:03

All right.

33:06

But you can talk about it if you want to.

33:07

If you want, you can compare your answers,

33:09

but not I got 255.

33:12

What did you get? So make

33:15

it somehow not so clear.

33:23

The reason for it. If your answer is

33:26

wrong and another personable

33:29

strict match them that answer.

33:30

That's going to be wrong too.

33:32

And those two will be so

33:34

wrong that there will be marked for for treating.

33:38

If the answers are very raw and very weird.

33:44

I'm not saying 255 in this case.

33:47

It has nothing to do with a problem.

33:49

But sometimes, I know I gave you this example before.

33:51

If you multiply 15 by two and you get some INT01,

33:56

I can understand that if you get 300,

34:00

I can understand that because yeah.

34:02

You did addition instead or you multiply them,

34:05

then you wrote an extra 0.

34:09

But if you get a ten-point

34:10

five and there will be two students that will get 18.5.

34:12

That is trench.

34:16

And I don't want any problems.

34:18

I don't want any kind of cheat.

34:21

And I'm going to be very light on gradient this quiz.

34:22

But I do want you to practice.

34:26

This is the main purpose of quizzes.

34:29

I think all of you will get high grades for quizzes,

34:34

but I do want you to practice with this material,

34:37

ok. You can always use any textbooks,

34:40

but please do not Google this questions.

34:46

Because if I see the solution

34:50

that matches some online solution,

34:52

I'm going to give set.

34:54

As I said before,

34:56

that the purpose of this quizzes is not to

34:58

grade you on the final,

35:00

final answer, but for you to practice.

35:04

Alright?

35:09

Now, if you cheat on this, quiz,

35:11

them on midterm, you may not get this question.

35:14

We write it on paper and secant it.

35:19

You can do it either way you want.

35:22

You can use later kick in right on paper.

35:23

For all quizzes, it's

35:25

assumed you're in class

35:28

and you're trying to do with fast.

35:29

Now, I must be able to read it.

35:31

Please write it clearly

35:35

and when you upload to great scope,

35:37

open it and make sure that I can read

35:39

it or who I was going to grade it, can create it.

35:41

Anything specific you are looking for.

35:45

And this is not really just give a good explanation.

35:47

So you need to, you don't need to

35:51

write anything extra you explanation,

35:54

but give a sufficient explanation

35:56

as to why you are using a particular formula

35:58

or any questions about anything at all.

36:01

I am not going to start a new part.

36:06

I deliberately finished right

36:09

now because the next part

36:12

is a little bit more complicated.

36:15

But by the time we moved to this,

36:17

I wanted to be very good and very clear on

36:19

the joint conditional probability

36:23

on all these marginal probabilities.

36:24

Or else I will talk and it will just.

36:26
