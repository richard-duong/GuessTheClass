00:00

This is where we stopped last time.

00:05

We need to look over the correlation.

00:08

I'm sure you know how to compute correlation.

00:10

It's not maybe unique to review.

00:13

In any case, it is not a complicated process.

00:16

Suppose we have two variables, x and y,

00:22

represented by a simple of end points of the form x i,

00:26

y i, where i is between 110.

00:33

X is correlated to y,

00:37

or y is correlated to x or x and

00:40

y are correlated when the value of x,

00:43

look at this has some predictive power on the value of y.

00:47

Which means if we know x,

00:53

then there is a way to predict a y.

00:55

Then there correlate.

00:58

Now, sometimes this word correlation

01:00

is used loosely correlated one depends on the other.

01:03

Now, it doesn't mean that.

01:09

It doesn't mean that if two variables are correlated,

01:13

then one depends on the other.

01:19

We will talk about that in a second.

01:21

But before we go, also,

01:23

you need to remember some times

01:26

correlated means that indeed,

01:28

why can be predicted from x,

01:32

but not necessarily linearly.

01:36

Sometimes correlation is meant as a linear correlation.

01:40

And sometimes this word is

01:48

used in when there is a correlation of any type.

01:51

Usually a book that uses the word correlation.

01:56

Usually they defined which way they're going to use.

02:01

We're going to talk about linear currently.

02:05

We're going to talk about linear correlation.

02:09

On these three pictures,

02:15

you can see a positive correlation.

02:18

If and if x grows,

02:21

y grows linearly with x.

02:25

Negative correlation.

02:28

If x grows, the value of y

02:30

goes down linearly with Y and no correlation,

02:34

we cannot predict y if we know X.

02:38

As we said before,

02:42

just because we see this picture or that picture,

02:45

just because two variables are correlated.

02:49

It does not mean that one depends on the other.

02:52

What could be the possibility?

02:59

First, confounding variables.

03:03

You collect data on sandbars in ice cream consumption.

03:08

You find that ice cream consumption is

03:13

associated with a higher probability of sunburn.

03:16

Does that mean that

03:21

ice cream consumption causes sunburns?

03:24

Will obviously with this data, yeah.

03:30

So what does it mean?

03:36

Ice cream causes Sandberg? Somebody says No.

03:39

Somebody says Yes, explain. Explain why.

03:47

Explain why know,

03:50

correlation isn't causation.

04:01

But that's true. But what does it mean to be no,

04:04

because just because ice cream consumption has is

04:13

correlated with sunburned doesn't

04:17

necessarily mean that ice cream causes sunburn.

04:20

It could be that it's really hot and everyone

04:23

is the beach and they're also eating ice cream.

04:25

But this is so hard they can also be getting sunburned.

04:30

Okay?

04:33

So first, first, it doesn't mean that

04:34

these two variables are variables cause one another.

04:38

Neither ice cream causes sunburn.

04:44

No ice cream necessarily causes the high consumption,

04:46

consumption of ice cream.

04:49

Well, maybe I'll feel more like eating ice cream,

04:52

but really it's not what

04:57

causes the high consumption of ice cream.

04:59

What does hot temperatures, right?

05:04

Hot temperature causes both.

05:06

It causes both.

05:09

The values increases at the same time.

05:11

The value simply increases at the same time,

05:15

but it doesn't mean that one is caused by the other.

05:18

When you see the picture,

05:21

when you see some sort of a correlation,

05:22

do not rush into drawn a conclusion.

05:24

Do not immediately conclude

05:27

that one is caused by the other.

05:30

It is a very big mistake to do so.

05:33

In this case, both are caused by a confounding variable.

05:36

There caused by another variable.

05:42

Which could be another picture of

05:46

two variables growing with

05:53

the same pattern as it is on this picture.

05:57

Like I said, we are going to,

06:00

when we're using correlation in our class,

06:02

we're going to talk about linear correlation.

06:05

In this case, this is not well,

06:08

it can't be looked at as almost linear,

06:11

but it's not really.

06:14

But the point that we want to make here,

06:16

that correlation does not mean causation.

06:19

I've read this red curve is

06:22

total revenue generated by arcades.

06:25

And the black curve.

06:28

Computer science doctorates awarded in the United States.

06:31

Are they really that coordinated?

06:35

Well they are.

06:39

But simply because their values

06:42

or so close to each other,

06:46

it doesn't mean that one causes the other.

06:48

Please remember that.

06:53

Again. From now on,

06:56

when we use the word correlation,

07:00

we are going to be talking about

07:01

linear scaling

07:04

play a role in misleading.

07:12

Well, I'm not sure I understand the question of can

07:17

scaling play a role in misleading correlations,

07:20

like how the data is presented?

07:23

How the data is presented,

07:26

of course, can play a role.

07:27

You can always what we will talk a little bit,

07:29

we will talk a little bit about it.

07:33

And also I'm going to

07:35

suggest a book later on just to remind

07:37

me of how by presenting the data in a specific way,

07:39

you can mislead the reader.

07:44

Data is a very powerful tool.

07:47

And you can prove anything just

07:52

by presenting your data in

07:54

some smart to this awake or the way

07:56

that is going to support your argument no matter whether

08:02

your argument is right or wrong.

08:05

Alright?

08:09

Computer correlation.

08:11

This is an interesting question,

08:13

not just from the point of computer correlation,

08:15

but for your main b0 to apply in practice.

08:20

If you are dealing with this pedicle,

08:24

Joan is an investor.

08:28

He's portfolios primarily tracks the performance,

08:29

the S and P 500.

08:32

And John wants to add the stock of Apple.

08:34

Before adding Apple to his portfolio,

08:38

he wants to assess the correlation

08:42

between the stalk and the S and P 500 to

08:44

ensure that adding this talk won't

08:48

increase the systematic risk of his portfolio.

08:52

To find the coefficient,

08:58

John gathers the falling process for the last five years.

09:01

These are the values of S and P 500 and apples.

09:07

How to compute the correlation

09:21

between these two variables.

09:26

This is the formula, but we

09:29

will go a little bit slower than that.

09:31

We will compute the mean of each.

09:33

Next. We need to compute each of

09:40

this difference and each of this difference.

09:45

The first and the SEC.

09:51

Just the difference between the mean.

09:55

And the value itself each valued,

09:58

so all right, that's it.

10:02

That's this one.

10:05

And next is their product.

10:07

Next is the product.

10:11

Find the sum and

10:14

divide by the square root of the squares.

10:19

There is nothing difficult right here.

10:24

Besides, you can always use just

10:27

type the word right here and it's good to do it for you.

10:30

Nevertheless, whatever you're using,

10:35

you should know how it works

10:38

and you should know the formula.

10:39

Because if you see this value doesn't make sense,

10:41

you need to understand where they're coming

10:44

from and you only do if you understand how it works.

10:46

So if you're using these packages,

10:51

Python packages, I'm fine with it.

10:54

You will not need to write the code unless you want to,

10:56

unless you want to practice.

11:01

But you still need to know exactly how it works.

11:03

Well, at least in this case,

11:08

later on when we start

11:09

working on machine learning algorithms.

11:11

Sometimes I will tell you,

11:13

if you didn't go over it in calculus,

11:15

then it's OK. You can just use this particular function.

11:18

All right?

11:22

The answer right here,

11:24

or the value right here is

11:26

0.95. the value for

11:28

the correlation is between negative 11.

11:31

We will see and define a little bit stricter later on.

11:36

What is the positive negative correlation?

11:42

What is this strong correlation

11:44

in weak correlation and so on.

11:46

But at this point,

11:48

you understand that if the value is very close to one,

11:50

it means a strong positive correlation.

11:53

And if the value is close to negative one,

11:56

it is a strong negative correlation.

11:59

So the closer to one,

12:03

the stronger the correlation.

12:05

What does it mean in this case?

12:07

That means that both

12:11

will increase the values

12:15

or decrease the values at the same time.

12:18

Is it useful this trophy correlating, right?

12:21

One is going to increase the value,

12:24

there is going to increase, develop.

12:26

We're not going to know the reason behind it.

12:28

What's happened there.

12:31

We don't know, but we understand

12:32

that if he adds Apple to his portfolio,

12:34

what's going to happen?

12:38

In other words, should he or should he not?

12:41

It looks like you'll make a little money.

12:55

He should. You'll make a lot of money.

12:58

Any other point of view? It's highly

13:00

correlated with S and P 500.

13:09

S&p 500s will go down. What's happened to Apple?

13:12

Apple will also go down, go down.

13:17

Not because one went down,

13:21

but because we found that they're correlated,

13:23

strongly correlated one goes down,

13:25

the other goes down. What happens?

13:27

He increases.

13:29

He increases the risk.

13:36

He increases the risk.

13:42

So as you guys answered on chat,

13:48

if he does not want to increase the risk,

13:53

then he should not be Apple stocks.

13:56

If he wants to decrease the risk,

14:01

then this correlation should be strongly negative.

14:06

Then when one goes down,

14:09

the other one will go up.

14:12

Okay?

14:16

Alright.

14:21

It a little bit more about,

14:25

well, in this course,

14:30

in this case,

14:32

I wouldn't use the word curly correlation,

14:39

but some dependence on the other.

14:43

First, Google n-grams.

14:47

I advise you if you have time,

14:49

find Google n-grams where

14:52

you can just type it on the search engine.

14:55

In fact, if you want, I can do it right

14:57

now and show you how it works.

14:59

This is how it looks.

15:21

Just like Google n-grams or am

15:25

Graham. What is it?

15:29

Google decided to scan

15:41

all of the world's published books.

15:45

Of course, it's not finished right now.

15:48

Right now, more than 20% of

15:50

all books that were published to a scant,

15:53

probably most frequently read

15:56

book of the well-known books.

16:00

But they in this process.

16:03

Now, Google n-grams provide the frequency with

16:05

which word or a short phrase for curves.

16:10

In books published from

16:16

particularly here or from

16:21

the year that they started using it.

16:24

For this part of the work that is being used.

16:27

You can use just a single word or you can use phrases.

16:32

If you happen to use a phrase that is not there,

16:38

that is not shown is not used,

16:42

then you simply will not find a high usage of it.

16:44

Or you may find a 0 if it is

16:47

a phrase that was never used,

16:49

but there is no harm to play.

16:52

What I decided to use right here on

16:54

this picture is simply three words.

16:57

Capitalism, socialism, and communism.

17:00

How frequently they've been used.

17:03

And just by looking at this

17:06

in grams, how they're correlated.

17:09

Again, in this case correlated,

17:13

I don't mean linear correlation

17:15

as we are going to be talking about.

17:17

Just look at this pattern.

17:20

You can read somewhat of a history

17:22

just by looking at increase or decrease,

17:26

relative increase or decrease,

17:31

both at particular term.

17:32

For example, right here.

17:36

Where actually you can tell me,

17:41

actually you can tell me these are

17:45

some of the peaks or from here,

17:49

from this point on,

17:51

something is going down.

17:53

What are, what do you think

17:55

are the reasons or what may be the reasons?

17:57

Because when ever you

18:00

start looking for patterns in your data,

18:02

you start with some sort of a hypothesis,

18:04

some sort of analysis.

18:08

In this case, look at

18:10

this curves and see something must be gone.

18:13

Or maybe either right here or maybe right here,

18:16

or maybe right here.

18:20

Or I don't know.

18:22

Maybe it this point,

18:24

this point right here.

18:26

So I tried to explain

18:28

any

18:32

search terms

18:56

for

18:58

communism and socialism spike

18:58

during approximately beginning of the Cold War,

19:00

after World War II.

19:03

They drove around the time when they used to serve holds.

19:05

Good.

19:08

Actually.

19:09

It's a great analysis.

19:11

Very good just by looking at it.

19:13

Right here. Nineties for,

19:16

right, they're not quite sure when it works.

19:20

It uses her and the Soviet camp right here.

19:22

It's fallen in Eastern Europe.

19:28

But that's exactly the time socialism,

19:31

The term is going down.

19:34

And capitalism is rapidly going

19:36

up compared to socialism, at least, well,

19:39

it continues, but compared to

19:42

socialism is going my child.

19:44

Communism, right?

19:47

What about the Communist?

19:49

And in this era, this

19:50

is around the time when Stalin

19:58

died for shock came to power.

20:01

And slowly communism is going to,

20:05

the term of communism is going down, right?

20:09

The time of World War One.

20:13

Right here, right there somewhere.

20:15

Don't quit your dog, Quincy.

20:18

Now, this this is the time.

20:20

This is the time of World War II.

20:25

And after that point,

20:29

socialism was tried in going up.

20:31

Socialism is going up.

20:34

So in this case,

20:36

this is just one simple quick analysis.

20:38

Whatever we knew before we apply.

20:41

Of course, if we if we didn't know anything about it,

20:44

we probably wouldn't be able to complete the analysis,

20:50

but why did they bring this into the picture?

20:54

Not because I wanted to show you

20:58

one nice simple thing to wealth.

21:00

It required lots of work,

21:04

but Google, of course,

21:05

but it's relatively easy

21:07

to implement once this Kanban books.

21:09

What I wanted to point out,

21:12

when you are dealing with data,

21:15

when you're dealing with a particular data set.

21:18

If you're picking a project for class,

21:20

you need to understand what you're talking about.

21:23

You need to understand very well

21:27

for the era that you're analyzing.

21:29

If you are working and you happen to have

21:31

a project to something that you don't have a clue about,

21:34

but you do need to analyze.

21:39

It.

21:40

Gets, a lot of times as

21:41

computer scientists, as data scientists,

21:42

we have to do things that are absolutely

21:45

unrelated to what we feel comfortable working with.

21:47

I don't know how well,

21:51

you know, political science,

21:52

biology, chemistry would if

21:53

you need to analyze that data.

21:55

The first and the main point that I want to make

21:57

here tried to get into that concept.

22:00

Don't do it blindly.

22:04

Read at least a little bit,

22:05

at least enough to understand what your attributes mean,

22:08

what is reasonable, what is not

22:12

reasonable gets some basic idea.

22:13

Okay? Do not just take

22:17

the random data sets and try to analyze it.

22:20

It's not going to lead to anything useful.

22:23
