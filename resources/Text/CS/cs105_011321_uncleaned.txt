00:00

Something that is very easy.

00:05

I told you as far as the visualization,

00:07

a lot of stuff will be something

00:09

that you worked with before in

00:12

what I would like or what I wanted to

00:15

do is to combine all of those.

00:18

So when it comes to

00:21

some presentation to the time

00:23

and you need to perform data visualization.

00:26

You have all of this in

00:29

one set of slides and he will go through it.

00:30

You will decide what it is you want

00:33

to use for your particular case.

00:36

So that is more like a guide for you of what to do.

00:38

Of course, bar charts is something that you know,

00:43

that's probably one of

00:47

the easiest forums to present information.

00:48

And yet sometimes it's better than

00:51

any other more complicated form.

00:53

For example, this one is showing

00:55

the number of electrode right here.

00:58

Let me increase there.

01:01

All right. The number

01:05

of the number of residents part electoral vote.

01:09

When you're looking at this chart,

01:15

you can understand that the number of people

01:18

per one vote is very uneven and very different.

01:21

In some states, you need to have

01:26

about 200 thousand people

01:29

per one vote in August takes 700.

01:31

Why it is we don't have time right now to

01:39

deal with this question and when this, with this answer.

01:42

But if you're interested, go and look up.

01:45

In other, another visual

01:53

that represents the results of the elections for 2012.

01:59

If you remember, Barack Obama von won this election,

02:05

which is below right here.

02:11

These are the states that were pro,

02:15

democratic in this election.

02:20

Now, if you look at this map,

02:22

it looks like there's more red than blue.

02:23

But if you look at the numbers,

02:28

the numbers represent the number of

02:30

electoral votes that went towards the victory.

02:34

And there are over 300 electoral votes that were

02:37

for the Democratic candidate

02:44

and for the republicans, over 200.

02:47

But when you look at this map,

02:52

there is some sort of misrepresentation because

02:54

the area covered by red is much larger.

02:57

What the authors did right here.

03:02

The reduced area of a state if the number of

03:05

electoral votes that the state gives is

03:10

proportionally lower than for other states.

03:12

So right here that area represents,

03:16

or rabbit is proportional

03:20

to the number of electoral votes.

03:22

Now, this, when you look at this map,

03:24

you already see that there is more blue than

03:28

red in this case.

03:32

So this is how you can use a map,

03:36

but with a little change. Yeah.

03:40

This is the book I told you.

03:48

I'm going to be given you books

03:50

rather than give you one textbook.

03:51

I will give you suggestions about

03:53

different books that I use for particular topics.

03:55

For this topic, I used mostly

04:00

to ski and the data science design manual.

04:03

In fact, I do like this book four.

04:08

I used it for a number of topics.

04:11

So if you can find it and you'll be able to find it,

04:13

I would suggest using this book.

04:16

Scanner is a great author.

04:19

The wiki presents information,

04:21

is very easy to understand.

04:23

And they will be the second book that I will show you.

04:27

It's on the slides as well.

04:30

Right here.

04:32

Now.

04:34

Bar charts, bar charts as

04:36

opposed to stack charts as same bar turns his mom.

04:39

Now, in this case, in this case,

04:43

we'll look at the number

04:49

of people that purchased tickets to titanic,

04:54

buy ticket classes, the first class,

05:01

the second, the third.

05:04

So that is the first-class, the whole bar.

05:06

Second in the third.

05:09

Now, the red area represents the number of people.

05:12

If you look right here, that's the number of

05:18

people who purchase tickets to

05:20

the first-class and died

05:23

as a result of the tragedy on Titanic.

05:25

The blue is the number of people that survived.

05:28

Some information.

05:35

You can read some information from this butcher.

05:37

Now, if you change a little bit,

05:39

the way you are representing your information, too weird.

05:44

The tickets that are purchased to the first class,

05:49

second class, and third class will be taken as one each.

05:55

And then he will show the percent of

06:01

people of the first class that died,

06:05

of the second class and third class or that died,

06:09

you will see a slightly better information.

06:13

You will see immediately and understand immediately.

06:17

The higher the class,

06:21

the richer you are,

06:23

the higher the chance to survive.

06:26

So before you

06:30

Start on your visuals.

06:34

First.

06:36

Don't look at just numbers.

06:37

Try to understand what is

06:40

the idea that I wanted to deliver?

06:43

And what you want to point

06:46

out that there is

06:49

a high percent of rich people that survived,

06:50

then this is probably what you want to do.

06:54

Again. By the way,

07:03

do you see well,

07:06

on your screens isn't big enough.

07:08

Okay.

07:13

Next example.

07:21

Again, bar charts, a little bit differently constructed,

07:24

but the same word charts.

07:28

Now, what is shown right here?

07:30

For each country?

07:34

It is shown for the number

07:38

of people that died in World War II.

07:42

This is a red bar

07:46

and the gray bar is the percent of the population.

07:49

So the red bar is the number of people.

07:55

The green bar is the is the percent of the population.

07:59

Do you like this bar chart?

08:04

No.

08:10

Would you use just the same

08:12

or would you change something?

08:14

If you change why?

08:17

You're saying it's very hard to read.

08:26

Just look at the colors, right?

08:30

No longer red bar represents the population.

08:32

For example, close to 24 million people

08:35

died from Soviet Union.

08:39

And then so one for each country.

08:41

And the green is the percent of the population,

08:45

for example, about 14%, Soviet Union.

08:50

So assume it is easy to read.

08:57

That's why I asked you if you can see it well or not.

09:02

Maybe it's just not the best picture.

09:06

Is there anything else that bothers you?

09:10

It's kinda weird how they're combining onto one skill,

09:17

like a millions I'm gonna percentage.

09:20

I agree. I agree.

09:22

It's quite misleading.

09:24

When you look at this red and gray,

09:25

it seems like, Alright,

09:28

maybe more than half of the population died.

09:30

Is that what they wanna say?

09:33

No, actually, it's just the units

09:34

right here are different,

09:37

but the numbers are the same,

09:39

but the units are different.

09:41

If you're willing to understand,

09:42

of course it can go through this and

09:44

it has all the correct information.

09:46

But is the visual itself is the greatest?

09:48

I wouldn't use it.

09:53

I wouldn't do this one.

09:55

Very representative.

10:03

But the one thing that I wanted to notice right here,

10:05

again, World War casualties, Poland,

10:09

17.2% of the population,

10:13

Soviet Union, 14.2, Yugoslavia,

10:18

and so on and so forth.

10:22

So in this case,

10:24

you can see the percentage of the population clearly.

10:27

Is there anything that you noticed that

10:31

you may want to give additional information about?

10:35

Probably if you know a little bit of

10:42

history, then you would notice.

10:44

If not, then you may not.

10:46

Nothing that you see.

10:59

What do you want to be.

11:08

The Soviet Union is a huge country.

11:12

At that point, the word 15 republics,

11:15

which later became 15 countries.

11:18

Depends on how you

11:23

count the number of republics right here,

11:25

or all added together.

11:31

And we're told that there are

11:33

about 14% of the population died.

11:35

But in fact, if you take billers

11:39

or sometimes you can hear bela russia by itself.

11:42

It is going to be on

11:46

proportionally large percent of the population that died,

11:48

which is well above the pole once.

11:53

So, you will look

11:59

at the failures and you will look at Ukraine,

12:01

those or two countries.

12:04

Well, right now there are

12:07

countries that were republics of

12:08

that time that lost,

12:09

mostly percentage wise. Why?

12:11

Now, when you see this,

12:15

then you go and you read about

12:17

this period of time and you

12:19

understand it's not enough

12:21

just to put the numbers on the chart.

12:24

You need to understand what's going on.

12:26

And every time when we have a lecture,

12:29

when I'm talking about data science,

12:33

every time I'm going to stress it.

12:35

Data Science. Of course,

12:38

it is about the numbers,

12:40

about the data, about the science, about analysis.

12:42

Also, you need to understand what's going on.

12:45

You need to make sense of your data.

12:48

Okay?

12:57

Next, if your data is given as a table,

12:59

if you receive the table as your data,

13:04

you should be happy because it's easy to work with.

13:07

But do you want to show it as a table?

13:11

For example, you are given a project for

13:15

question and you'd have to perform some analysis.

13:18

And then you have

13:22

some finance as the result of your analysis.

13:24

Now it's time for you to

13:26

present your findings, present your data.

13:28

Do you want to present it as a table? Well, maybe not.

13:31

There are other ways of doing it,

13:36

because when you simply throw the results into the table,

13:39

I have to go through all of these numbers and try to

13:43

make sense myself of what it is you're trying to show.

13:47

Well, it's clear what this data is in the table.

13:52

We can do it, but there are better ways.

13:56

The first and the easiest.

13:58

Color.

14:01

If you don't have time,

14:02

you run out of time in 1 second,

14:04

you have to present it.

14:07

Let's change the color.

14:08

But even if you

14:10

don't have a lot of time to think about a better visual,

14:14

stay with the same table,

14:17

but use a heatmap.

14:19

This is the same table.

14:21

And Python can actually read from your table

14:25

and assign a color to each cell of the table.

14:29

So that what you do one function,

14:34

then you go from this to the vet.

14:37

Suppose you wanted to point out these two events.

14:41

You don't need to talk much there already. There.

14:46

They will already attract

14:49

the viewer's attention right away.

14:51

Okay. Alright.

14:55

Another scatterplots applauds.

14:58

We have to numeric variables and we

15:02

want to show the relation between them.

15:04

Very good to use scatterplots.

15:06

In this case. In this case,

15:09

once you plot them,

15:11

you can see that there is a positive correlation,

15:13

very strong positive correlation.

15:17

Now, he can say it is a linear correlation.

15:20

We said last time that mostly we use

15:23

the word correlation in this class.

15:25

Point out to the linear.

15:27

Now second picture, it is a negative correlation.

15:29

It certainly isn't strong or weak correlation,

15:33

but you can see this is

15:36

a negative correlation and no correlation whatsoever.

15:38

And in this case, dependence is quadratic,

15:41

or at least it looks like a quadratic,

15:45

then you may find that it

15:48

is some sort of a high degree polynomial.

15:49

If you plot more data, if you have more data,

15:52

but there is certainly a correlation.

15:55

And the correlation here is not

15:57

meaning you can immediately tell it from debt.

15:59

So when you just get your data

16:03

and you see lots of numbers,

16:06

you're looking at this numbers.

16:10

What do I have there?

16:12

I have no idea.

16:13

Somebody asks you to analyze it.

16:15

Start with visuals.

16:17

Well, you can start with

16:20

either summative statistics or with visuals.

16:22

You need to do both.

16:25

Run different visual analytics.

16:27

And maybe you will see

16:30

immediately that there is some pattern in them data.

16:32

Which one?

16:36

You don't know.

16:39

You don't know.

16:40

Suppose you get a bunch of numbers.

16:41

How to start, where to start where to plot?

16:43

Just try. Just try it.

16:46

Now, a scatter plot right

16:50

here is presented for two variables,

16:52

is done for two years.

16:57

You can do it for three variables where the third,

16:58

you can add the third dimension,

17:01

but then it is somewhat different.

17:03

Difficult already.

17:06

To make sense of the pattern,

17:07

what you can do is to present

17:10

a scatterplot matrix, scatter plot matrix.

17:13

These are all of the attributes or

17:18

the variables you construct at matrix.

17:21

These are attributes.

17:27

And then each pair is presented as a scatterplot matrix.

17:31

Each pair of variables, these weak,

17:38

if there is a strong relation between any two,

17:42

then you will spot it.

17:46

For example, right here,

17:47

it's somewhat weak, but it is a

17:49

positive, certainly positive correlation.

17:50

Now, this matrix is symmetric.

17:53

This matrix is symmetric.

17:57

Very useful.

18:01

Next, time series.

18:07

We talked a little bit last time about time series.

18:10

What is good about time series?

18:14

And this is cardiogram.

18:18

Also time-series.

18:21

What is good about time series?

18:24

You can see, you can notice that trend,

18:27

whether it is a cyclic or maybe the seasonal weather.

18:32

Right here, for example.

18:39

You see increased, the value increases in time,

18:42

decreases and times are decreases

18:47

in time or increases in time.

18:49

Or maybe the reasonable pattern you don't know.

18:53

Or in this case,

18:57

maybe it is not changing much.

18:58

But the changes or sell them or major changes a seldom,

19:04

and you don't see a pattern in them.

19:10

But these three are very representative of time series.

19:15

The reason why you may want to use time series.

19:23

Next, everytime I show you,

19:28

I'm trying to go one step further.

19:32

These are the same time series,

19:35

but we also added,

19:38

I don't mean the same as were on the previous,

19:41

on the previous slide,

19:44

but these are also time series.

19:45

But in this case,

19:48

we added color to the representation.

19:49

And if you want to look at

19:53

time series in here per season or per months,

19:56

then it is very easy to see what you want to deliver.

20:00

The temperatures are low right here,

20:05

and towards the center of the temperatures are going up.

20:08

During the day, the temperatures are going up.

20:11

Of course, all of your note that,

20:14

but that's the reason why I showed you

20:16

this hit map for time series right here.

20:19

So you can understand easily how to use it when

20:22

to use waterfall chart.

20:24

Please tell me, did you see this types of

20:32

charts before the waterfall chart?

20:35

Do you see it clearly?

20:40

Right here? Can you see it or you want me to increase?

20:42

Maybe the size like that?

20:45

Never have. Never have.

20:48

Okay.

20:51

Most of you didn't see those Before?

20:52

I haven't seen this charts used very frequently.

20:55

So for some reason they are used quite sold them in yet,

21:04

if you understand how it works,

21:08

it is a great way to present information.

21:11

Let me explain to you how it

21:15

works and you will try to come up with

21:17

examples of where you'd want

21:20

to use this type of waterfall charts.

21:23

I will try to mask the idea of what it can be used for.

21:27

So for example, we started

21:33

with something that is 50 units.

21:35

We gained 40, then we

21:39

gained therapy which resulted with a 120.

21:42

Then we gained 1020 and lost,

21:48

I think it is 50 Atkins and the result is 100.

21:51

Now, this intermediate cause,

21:56

we can make a decision whether you want

21:58

to include an intermediate column.

22:01

You possibly you won't have Amy,

22:03

maybe you will have one or two.

22:05

It's up to you to decide.

22:07

What do you, where do you think

22:10

is a good time to use this type of charts?

22:13

And I just said the changes

22:26

over different time intervals.

22:28

My sensor, where exactly

22:31

stock price, stock price.

22:43

For stock market, it's very representative.

22:47

That's a great way to present the changes.

22:51

Because here you don't really concentrate on the numbers.

22:55

You see in grows quite a bit more.

22:59

Then it goes down.

23:04

And you see what we started with,

23:06

what we ended with.

23:09

So it's a great way to present that type of information.

23:11

Let's continue. Another one

23:20

that you probably have not seen before.

23:24

Let me see.

23:27

Maybe it's not big enough.

23:28

Is it good enough?

23:31

Alright.

23:34

Getting ready.

23:37

I can increase my alright. Spider chart.

23:39

Have you seen this one before? Yes. Okay.

23:47

Some of you did.

23:54

Okay. Now, this is

23:57

something that you want to experiment with.

24:00

What is the spider chart to go into

24:04

show competitor analysis spider term,

24:07

product one, product two, product three.

24:12

We're looking at the three products.

24:17

We are comparing the products or marketing strategy

24:19

or whatever you decide to compare about this products.

24:23

Now, put the number right here,

24:28

a variable, or the number of products in this case,

24:31

should not be large,

24:34

or else you're going to lose information here.

24:36

You will not be able to make sense.

24:40

But when the number is three,

24:43

for example, then it is very nice.

24:45

Now, these are attributes is you notice the number of

24:47

attributes right here is also not very large.

24:51

123456788 is fine.

24:55

I would say maybe five to ten is okay.

25:01

In the number of products inside, in this case,

25:05

or the number of data data points is not large.

25:08

In this case, we have three products

25:15

and we're going to compare them.

25:18

How are they compared in price?

25:20

The green one is for

25:22

the yellow to the blue one now is at $1 to four.

25:26

What do you think it is?

25:32

Some sort of relative scale?

25:38

I don't think it really matters

25:41

what the number is as long as

25:43

we can compare each products to each other.

25:44

True too.

25:47

So it could be some sort of a rating.

25:49

It could be some sort of a relative number, right?

25:51

In this case. But to a lot of times,

25:55

we can't compare when we're dealing with a rating.

25:58

In any case, you can see that the green one wins here.

26:05

Here, there is first advertisement, not so much.

26:10

As far as the service.

26:16

It's at the bottom, well together with a blue one,

26:18

and then so on and so forth.

26:21

So you can go and compare.

26:24

Now, if you're choosing between 23 cars,

26:26

which one you want to buy,

26:31

then probably that's the best thing to do.

26:33

Because it's easy to make a decision in that case.

26:38

Now, look at this one.

26:42

Apple versus Samsung.

26:45

Apple versus Samsung.

26:51

You can represent the same information with a Boucher.

26:56

This is for simpson,

27:00

This is for iPhone. Is it good, bad?

27:02

Well, in this case,

27:05

I really don't care about the bar chart

27:06

because what it compare right here is not comparable.

27:09

What do I compare that display quality to the processor?

27:13

I don't really compare them.

27:18

I can see how they are being rated,

27:20

but it doesn't tell me

27:24

much if I'm trying to make a decision between.

27:26

A symptom phone or iPhone.

27:29

This is a little better.

27:33

As far as the design.

27:35

Most people like Samsung.

27:37

As far as the price?

27:39

Well, they about the same.

27:41

No, I'm not saying it's not my opinion.

27:43

It is not any kind of late time.

27:45

I would say rating.

27:51

It is just I've read in from the chart.

27:53

As far as the camera Samson's cameras better, right here,

27:56

you can see the processor,

28:00

the processors, or about the same.

28:02

So according to this chart,

28:04

it looks like Samsung is better overall.

28:08

Well, it's not true.

28:12

But according to this chart, Samsung is better.

28:14

You can always manipulate your data.

28:19

And if you work for SAMHSA,

28:21

that would be a great church.

28:24

Especially if you know that

28:25

iPhone is better in some areas,

28:28

you can just usefully forget this areas, right?

28:30

So sometimes it depends on how you represent your data.

28:35

You can sell anything to anybody.

28:40

As data scientists, you want it

28:42

to be honest and you want to know,

28:44

especially when somebody's trying to

28:46

sell anything to you,

28:47

you want to be aware of it.

28:49

You try. So let's fill in anything to me.

28:52

You will hurt. You will have a hard time.

28:55

Okay? And I want you to be that way to analyze,

28:57

analyze, do not trust anything.

29:04

Analyze yourself.

29:06

Alright?

29:10

Another kind, parallel coordinates plot.

29:12

Parallel coordinates plot.

29:17

Alright, we have two items,

29:20

a yellow item and a blue item.

29:24

Again, this one is

29:27

useful when you compare and maybe 2-3 for products.

29:29

Now, these are the attributes.

29:38

These are the variables or attributes.

29:41

If you compare, for example,

29:44

you're buying two cars and one is

29:46

the one variables is a mileage and so on and so forth.

29:49

Okay?

29:53

So then you can see how

29:54

they're compared when one is better than the other.

29:57

And on that basis,

30:00

you already can make a decision.

30:02

It is useful when you don't have too many variables.

30:06

It is useful when you don't have too many products.

30:14

Here, you see there are two items.

30:19

That's clear.

30:21

Now.

30:22

This you may say

30:23

it's not clear because you have too many items.

30:26

On the other hand,

30:28

while this one is still good and still clear.

30:30

Because even though these are being different items,

30:33

they all belong to the same cluster of items.

30:37

Then in this case,

30:42

what you want to deliver is how

30:44

Classes.

30:47

You can look into this example more.

30:49

If you look at the following data set,

30:53

a very famous Irish statistic from UCI.

30:56

In fact, you say repository has a lot of datasets.

31:00

And if you ever want to

31:05

do a project or just to play with some data,

31:08

you can always use UCI repository.

31:12

You can find something useful

31:16

for permanently for machine learning projects.

31:17

So this is the famous iris data set.

31:22

The information is collected on the flower on iris.

31:27

That pedal length and so on and so forth.

31:32

If you take a fluorine,

31:37

you don't know which type in which species it belongs to.

31:40

And you plot this,

31:45

the values for the variables on the following chart.

31:48

It will give you for the answer to

31:52

your question which species it most likely belongs to.

31:55

Okay? Because if it follows the yellow pattern,

31:59

then it is this.

32:02

Get exposed in green parents 14 wherever its color,

32:04

then it is insulin.

32:07

Again. Be careful with parallel coordinates.

32:10

So in this case,

32:16

when we have a number,

32:19

of course right here being compared,

32:22

in this case, it's already very difficult to make sense.

32:24

If you are looking at

32:28

the course of the same 10K, for example.

32:30

For example, this three belong to the same, make,

32:33

this 35 belong to a different one,

32:37

but then change the color for them.

32:41

And it will become much more representative.

32:43

Pie charts.

32:51

Well, you can see pie charts are evil. Yes.

32:53

No.

32:59

It's a matter of opinion,

33:00

of course, is a matter of opinion.

33:02

But now, for the following few slides,

33:04

I used this book Storytelling with Data.

33:11

I advise you to look at this book.

33:13

You can read it in probably an hour.

33:18

It is very useful,

33:21

just runs through it.

33:22

And you will see some examples of visuals.

33:25

How to use the wind to use them.

33:29

You may want to find something useful from that book.

33:31

I'm sure you will find something here,

33:36

so it is very,

33:38

very easy to, to read.

33:39

I advise you to, to look into it.

33:42

Again, that the books that I've shown you,

33:44

either they're free or you can

33:48

just connect to your series libraries through VPN.

33:51

And it will allow you to read those books.

33:56

You can always access them was 1.

34:00

Now, the author of

34:03

this book says the pie charts are evil.

34:04

Well, she's very opinionated

34:08

towards or rather against pie charts.

34:10

I wouldn't be saying don't

34:14

use them ever forever and ever.

34:15

She gives some very good examples

34:18

of where pie charts certainly should not be used.

34:21

Especially 3D point shirts,

34:25

three d pie charts are very misleading, very misleading.

34:27

Supply marketshare.

34:33

Look at a and which one is it can be.

34:34

And even, I guess it is a team.

34:39

Which one is greater by hut,

34:43

by how much can we tell from it?

34:45

Now, if we put a percentage right here,

34:48

it looks like this one is.

34:51

And think it chunk.

34:54

But if you still look there,

34:56

then the blue one small.

34:58

So you can see that you're honest, waited,

35:04

and always. As always.

35:06

If you want to lie,

35:09

you're welcome to use this kind of a pie chart.

35:11

What does it say about 2D pie charts?

35:16

Okay, let's get to the 2D pie charts.

35:20

Now, even was 3D pie charts,

35:24

sometimes you can make a point.

35:26

But this is the case where you should

35:29

not use it if you don't want to live with it.

35:31

To d pie charts.

35:33

Now, this one is really just not

35:35

useful because you can not read that.

35:38

Now.

35:41

Can you compare this?

35:42

Well, it's probably as good as

35:44

just simply writing it line by line.

35:46

And these are all the examples from that book.

35:50

And I do advise you to go and

35:54

look through that book. It's very useful.

35:56

Okay?

35:58

Now, this one is a little bit easier to comprehend.

35:59

But so this is the survey results.

36:05

So there was some sort of a training.

36:09

And before the training and after the train.

36:12

The same information is presented as a set

36:18

of two is a set of several Buy Charts.

36:22

The comparison before and after,

36:25

before and after, before imposture.

36:27

This is a better way to deliver, again,

36:29

to deliver the information what you wanted to do,

36:35

you wanted to compare

36:38

the attitude to something before and after.

36:40

This pie chart is telling you about before,

36:45

this one about after.

36:51

Or does it have information in it?

36:52

Yes, it does. But what you want to point out

36:55

is how the attitude to something changed.

36:58

But then you want to

37:03

combined before and after and showed you,

37:06

show the change, right?

37:09

So this one is easy to read.

37:11

Now, suppose you have a bike quite charts,

37:14

just a regular co-chair of that.

37:18

You see a lot of times, let's say,

37:19

a number of female students in

37:23

CS compared to the number of male students.

37:27

Then maybe you will see,

37:32

I don't know the numbers.

37:34

I'm not ready to give you the exact percentage.

37:35

It will be waived worse than that.

37:37

If we're talking about CS Engineering,

37:39

it will be worse than that and we're concerned about it.

37:42

We want to bring more female students.

37:45

But in any case,

37:47

whatever it is, it is a great representation.

37:49

I think in this case,

37:52

pie chart is not evil.

37:53

So when you want to show

37:55

what part of a whole different group is taken.

37:58

And there were not so many groups in the

38:02

very incompatible in sizes than pie charts are good.

38:05

In this case, you would deliver

38:09

the message with the PyCharm.

38:11

That's my opinion.

38:13

You're welcome.

38:15

Too heavy on heatmaps.

38:15

Back to the heatmaps.

38:21

You can use different colors for Heatmaps.

38:26

But do you want to what it is?

38:33

You can tell with this hit map,

38:38

well, there's something run, there's something purple.

38:43

Who knows what they are.

38:45

If I look at the numbers,

38:46

I'll understand the numbers,

38:48

but I might as well live it as

38:49

a table because I don't know how to compare.

38:50

How do you compare this red with this purple?

38:54

I don't know.

38:59

Right? So if you want to give some sort of a comparison,

39:00

then it's better to use

39:04

different shades or different intensity

39:06

of the same color.

39:10

In this case, you deliver

39:12

more information and what you want,

39:13

what you want to tell,

39:17

what you want to

39:19

with the information that you want to give

39:21

the person that is looking at it should be able to

39:25

just look for a second and get your point.

39:27

That's the best type of a visual.

39:32

Now, if I want to know more,

39:37

I will read through it and I will understand,

39:40

of course, what are the differences in someone.

39:43

But I just look and I see,

39:47

alright, this catches my attention.

39:50

Then I see, this is all white.

39:54

Now, I agreed, what are the differences?

39:56

But I see that picture from there. But ready?

39:59

And the last slide,

40:05

again, again a table,

40:08

another table and a heatmap.

40:13

Especially if you're using Python,

40:16

it doesn't take any more than a minute

40:19

to turn this table to this heatmap,

40:22

which is the same table but just enhanced with color.

40:26

Alright, I'm going to stop right now.
